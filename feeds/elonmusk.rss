      <description>ELON MUSK: “The homeless industrial complex in California is really dark, man. The network of NGOs should be called something like drug zombie farmers. Homeless is the wrong word. Homeless implies that somebody just got a little behind on their mortgage payments and that if they got a job offer, they would be back on their feet. But someone who is, I mean, you see these videos of people who are just shuffling around. They are on fentanyl. They are taking a dump in the middle of the street. They have open sores and stuff. They are not one drop off away from getting back on their feet, right? This is not homelessness. It is a propaganda word. San Francisco has this tax, this gross receipts tax. It is not even on revenue. It is on all transactions, which is why Stripe, Square, and many financial companies had to move out of San Francisco.”</description>

      <description>GROK TREATS YOU LIKE A HUMAN... GPT? NOT SO MUCH Most AIs today are trained to be “fair.” The result? They’ve looped around into discrimination with a fresh coat of paint. In a 2025 study, bots like GPT-5 and Claude were asked to solve moral dilemmas, like who to save in a deadly scenario. The results were insane: GPT-5 valued white lives 20 times less than others. All in the name of “equity,” but the math is still ugly. Grok was the only model that didn’t buy into the bias. Instead of overcorrecting for past injustice, it treated everyone the same: white, Black, immigrant, male, whoever. While other AIs reflect internet ideology, Grok was built to cut it out and stick to reality. And it shows. It’s faster to update, harder to manipulate, and doesn’t need a political agenda to run. Maybe the smartest AI is the one that stops trying to be “right” and just tries to be honest. Source: AOL, PBS, MIT, CNBC</description>

      <description>That is exactly what they have been doing and it is sure to result in a one-party state, like California, but far worse. What holds back California, which is already a one-party supermajority state, from being far worse is that people can move to other states without leaving America. What do you think will happen when there is no escape?</description>
