      <description>BREAKING: Two men from Pennsylvania ADMIT to stealing $3.5 MILLION from public housing programs in Minnesota. They purposely traveled to Minnesota because they knew it would be easy to commit fraud there. You can't make this stuff up.</description>

      <description>SpaceX just officially shifted its #1 priority to building a self-growing city on the Moon. Not a base. Not an outpost. A city. Here's why it makes sense: you can launch to the Moon every 10 days vs. every 26 months for Mars. Two-day trip vs. six months. That means hundreds of iteration cycles before you could even attempt the same thing on Mars. And today Elon Musk followed up saying SpaceX will build a system that lets anyone travel to the Moon. The engineering logic here is sound. Build fast, learn fast, then go further.</description>

      <description>Grok Imagine 1.0 got a massive upgrade. You can now add multiple reference images under the edit option, letting you blend aesthetics from different sources into a single generation. Style mixing just got way easier!</description>

      <description>21 people are controlling computers with their thoughts. Not in a research demo. In their daily lives. Neuralink's Telepathy trial has nearly doubled since September. The implant reads your motor cortex and translates neural signals into digital commands. No voice. No eye tracking. No hands. One participant hit able-bodied cursor speeds in his first week. Others are typing at 40 words per minute using imagined finger movements. A med student uses it 17 hours a day to study. A woman who hadn't controlled a computer in 20 years is making art. A father with ALS rigged a 360 camera to his wheelchair and controls it telepathically so he can watch his kids. Next up: 3x the electrodes, a new trial targeting real-time speech at 140 WPM, and zero serious device-related adverse events across every participant so far. Brain-computer interfaces are no longer theoretical.</description>

      <description>The US government launchedrealfood.govwith Grok AI integration The official dietary guidelines site uses Grok because it's "maximally truth-seeking" and "willing to challenge mainstream narratives" Ask nutrition questions → Get real answers Not filtered through ideology...Just truth 🇺🇸</description>

      <description>Do you remember? I cannot recall a major political issue that 84% of the American people agree on. It’s kind of crazy to think about during this hyper partisan time. There are no reasons other than Congressional Corruption and election cheating for this not to pass. None.</description>

      <description>🔥 X’s Head of Product Nikita Bier on What It’s Really Like Working For Elon Musk “Elon will always do the hard things … We have to rebuild the algorithm or we have to build these data centers. I think that's the reason so much wealth has been created with his companies.”</description>
