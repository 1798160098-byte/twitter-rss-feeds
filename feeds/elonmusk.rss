      <description>In 1920, Mises dropped an intellectual atom bomb on socialism with a simple question: "How do you know what anything costs without market prices?" While Soviet planners were drowning in millions of arbitrary calculations, trying to set prices for everything from bread to bulldozers by committee, Mises had already proven it impossible. As Rothbard later quipped: "Socialist calculation is like trying to play chess blindfolded while your opponent keeps moving the board." Today's central bankers face the same delusion, believing they can calculate the "correct" interest rate for an entire economy. The result? The same chaos Soviet planners created, just with better marketing.</description>

      <description>It’s unbelievable what has happened to Britain. Just a few generations ago they were the greatest empire in the history of the world. Now their girls are being taken to Pakistan as sex slaves.</description>

      <description>Asmongold says we need to be even more aggressively hostile against woke, because they will do it to you (and have). I often say that the biggest tactical error is to not believe you are in a war, when the other side is eagerly warring against you.</description>

      <description>In 1861, to prevent border states from seceding, Lincoln occupied them with troops. He arrested the mayor of Baltimore and secessionist legislators in Maryland. SCOTUS said he exceeded his powers. Lincoln ignored SCOTUS.</description>

      <description>"But that darn Elon just went and tried it and it worked, and they cancelled our WHOLE program!" Here's an interesting story about how Elon Musk ambitiously skipped to the last step when trying to land on a barge with a rocket, proving supersonic retro-propulsion worked.@DrPhiltillknew someone working on a supersonic reentry program at NASA at the time who was shocked Elon was able to skip ahead, thus canceling their need for the program. Failing fast and forward not only saves so much money, but is more efficient and skips over steps you might not need. This lesson could even apply in your own life. This is my favorite part of my recent interview with Dr. Metzger.</description>

      <description>I read court transcripts of the Oxford rape gang trial. The details of the torture of one thirteen-year-old girl have never left me. Utterly horrific. No wonder the government wants this material erased. It is imperative these archives are preserved and made freely available.</description>
