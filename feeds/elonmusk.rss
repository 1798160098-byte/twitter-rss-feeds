      <description>This is how I knew so long ago that Reid Hoffman went to Epstein’s island. Epstein used Reid being there to try to get me to go, not realizing that it would have the opposite effect 😂</description>

      <description>Elon Musk has consistently raised the issue of holding Epstein's clients accountable. He's one of the voices that has kept the noise around this matter alive, preventing those with access to the evidence from concealing it: “I think the public will be rightly frustrated if no one is prosecuted for the Epstein client list. No one at all. Some number should at least be an attempted prosecution of the worst offenders. [If Ghislaine Maxwell is in jail for sex trafficking], that means sex trafficking occurred. So, who were the clients? So the proof is there. I mean, there's lots of videos. Whenever they raided Epstein's place, there would have been like a mountain of evidence. Where is that mountain? Like, who took possession of the evidence? Specifically.” Video:@MarioNawfal</description>

      <description>I am grateful to SpaceX President@Gwynne_Shotwelland personally to@elonmuskfor their swift response and for immediately beginning work on a solution. Elon Musk’s decision to urgently activate Starlink and send the first batch of terminals to Ukraine at the outset of the full-scale invasion was critical to the resilience of our state.</description>

      <description>Here’s the part nobody talks about: Elon is a big reason Ukraine can still defend itself In modern war, communication is the ultimate advantage When Russia invaded Ukraine, Elon sent the first batch of Starlink terminals and gave them vital connectivity when it mattered most That remains the key advantage Ukraine still has today</description>

      <description>Elon Musk: “I would encourage everyone to be optimistic and excited about the future. And generally, I think for quality of life, it is actually better to err on the side of being an optimist and wrong rather than a pessimist and right.” Legendary quote</description>

      <description>SpaceX just filed with the FCC to launch up to 1M satellites designed to function as solar-powered orbital data centers creating massive AI compute capacity in space. Elon wants to use Starship’s low launch costs and laser-linked satellites to scale AI compute without stressing Earth’s power grid.</description>

      <description>We didn't need it, but here's more confirmation. Tesla just eliminated everything in this graphic from the 4680 battery production process. Many actual battery companies haven't yet been able to do this. Tesla's cost per kWh for the 4680 was already more cost effective than getting comparable cells from suppliers. This breakthrough of solving DBE for the cathode will drive costs down further. This is a big deal$TSLA</description>

      <description>Nobody has fought harder for full release of the Epstein files and prosecutions of those who abused children more than I did, knowing full well that the legacy media, far-left propagandists and those who are actually guilty would: 1. Admit nothing 2. Deny everything 3. Make counter-accusations against me I knew that I would be smeared relentlessly, despite never having attended his parties or been on his “Lolita Express” plane or set foot on his creepy island or done anything wrong at all. Nonetheless, the extreme pain of being accused of being the opposite of who I am was worth it. The strong must protect those cannot protect themselves, especially vulnerable children. I will gladly accept any amount of future pain to do more to protect kids and give them a chance to grow up and have happy lives.</description>
