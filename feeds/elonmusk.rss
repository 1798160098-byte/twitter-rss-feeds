      <description>To be clear, I think we should only waive the filibuster to pass an election integrity act into law, but not for any other reason. Election integrity must include visual ID that proves citizenship and in-person voting (except in extreme circumstances like troops overseas).</description>

      <description>Go scroll this thread to see the child rapists, thugs and terrorists that the Trump Admin has been taking down in Minneapolis. THESE MONSTERS are who the Democrats have been out on the streets defending as they try to STOP law enforcement from doing their jobs. Insane.</description>

      <description>How long &amp; complicated can the deportation process be? Remember this Haitian gang member w/ 17 convictions who went viral for yelling “Fuck Trump, Biden forever” during my embed with ICE Boston 1 year ago? He’s still in ICE custody in the US. Despite having a deportation order, I’m told he continues to use every legal avenue &amp; appeal to try to avoid deportation. He is currently detained by ICE at a facility in Louisiana. We witnessed him get arrested by ICE in Boston on 1/22/25.</description>

      <description>MS-13 Illegals Just Hacked a 14-Year-Old to Death in Maryland: To the activists and politicians chanting “abolish ICE” — do this one thing: Look the 14-year-old’s mother in the face and say it. Say you don’t support the agency that exists to deport violent criminals before innocent lives are taken. Four illegal aliens connected to MS-13 were arrested in Maryland after allegedly hacking a 14-year-old boy to d*ath with a machete. This isn’t political theory. This isn’t rhetoric. This is a child who will never come home and a mother left to bury her son. This is why we stand with ICE. So violent criminals are removed before they destroy families. So tragedies like this don’t happen.</description>

      <description>🚨 URGENT CALL TO ACTION: FLOOD Senator Grassley's Office!🚨 Senator Chuck Grassley (@ChuckGrassley) is blocking the SAVE Act—refusing to support requiring proof of citizenship for federal voter registration, even though the Constitution empowers Congress to regulate elections! He wrote: “I do not believe that Iowa and other states need politicians in Washington, D.C. dictating and controlling how states run their elections.” This ignores what Republican voters DEMAND: secure elections NOW! We can't let RINOs stand in the way of election integrity under President Trump. **Tell@ChuckGrassleyto SUPPORT the SAVE Act IMMEDIATELY!** - **Washington D.C. Office Phone:** (202) 224-3744 - **Fax:** (202) 224-6020 - **Online Contact Form:**grassley.senate.gov/contact/…(Fill it out and demand he back the SAVE Act!) - **Official Website:**grassley.senate.govCall, email, fax—make your voice heard LOUD and CLEAR! Let him know Iowa voters (and patriots nationwide) won't stand for this betrayal. Hold him accountable! Tag him everywhere:@ChuckGrassley@GrassleyPress#SAVEAct#ElectionIntegrity#CallGrassley#MAGA#AmericaFirst🇺🇸</description>
