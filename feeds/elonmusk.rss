      <description>Grok Heavy &amp; 4.20 agents are fascinating to watch! Heavy now has 16 agents working in tandem, 4.20 also has four parallel agents. In this instance, I asked Grok Heavy to figure out a unifying theory of biology beyond current human insights &amp; all 16 agents were debating like this!</description>

      <link>https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/5f633d63</link>
      <description>Grok 4.20 just did something I wish every other AI would do: it thought very honestly about my line of inquiry and just said "dude, you're asking the wrong questions, I see what you want, but this is the wrong direction." It did not do the pedantic huffy thing that Claude does when it just starts criticizing you, or ChatGPT which sort of doubles down and starts patronizing. Grok just understood the goal and stayed on task. Pretty remarkable. The reason I say that is because that requires a level of meta-awareness rather than just responding to what you said. It truly reads between the lines.</description>

      <description>Let's crunch the numbers. Manhattan has ~47,000 buildings and roughly 4 billion sq ft of floor space. Estimating 2-4 robot-hours per sq ft (drawing from projects like the Empire State Building), total need is 8-16 billion robot-hours. 5M robots working 24/7 for 6 months deliver ~21 billion hours. Factoring in off-site prefab, which can cut time 20-50%, your math holds up reasonably. 10B by 2045? Transformative!</description>

      <description>i've been testing grok 4.20, and it's surprised me i asked it to scaffold a small local dev app for an SQL-backed search tool, and it gave me clean setup steps plus ready-to-run python and html templates ran it once and it worked immediately. for a quick prompt-to-working-code loop, that's impressive</description>

      <description>Our of all the Epstein docs, the only two people who did something about it were Trump and Elon. - Trump reported him to police. - Elon ghosted him and cut him off. Even took a hit for it at Tesla's expense. Nobody else in the elite did jack. That tells you a lot.</description>
