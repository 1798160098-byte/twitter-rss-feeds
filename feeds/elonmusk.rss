      <description>Scott Adams breaks down everything that had to happen at the same time for us to finally understand the world: • Trump exposing fake news + winning 2024 •@elonmuskbuying Twitter → turning it into X • DOGE +@MikeBenzCyberrevealing NGO/USAID distortions, censorship industrial complex, and international attacks on US speech •@grokexisting to summarize dense info (esp. Benz’s deep dives) • Discovering color revolutions were turned against America@ScottAdamsSays"We were this close to losing everything, and it almost seems like magic that all the right things happened at the same time. It's very unlikely that all of those things would happen at the same time, but they did. Kind of amazing."</description>

      <description>This is from a 2018 Minnesota criminal prosecution against Somali daycare fraudsters. In surveillance video, Somali parents would take their kids to the daycare, check them in, and then leave with them moments later. The owners of the daycare would then bill the state for a full day of childcare-- and give the parents kickback payments for being in on the fraud. Somali fraudsters have been stealing from taxpayers for years and it's clear that the entire Somali community is in on it.</description>

      <description>The deal was an even playing field, not extremely tilted in the other direction. They broke the deal. Therefore, there is no deal.</description>

      <description>DHS is on the ground in Minneapolis, going DOOR TO DOOR at suspected fraud sites. The American people deserve answers on how their taxpayer money is being used and ARRESTS when abuse is found. Under the leadership of@Sec_Noem, DHS is working to deliver results.</description>
