      <description>𝕏 IS THE BEST PLATFORM TO REACH WORLD’S MOST INFLUENTIAL LEADERS AND MOST POWERFUL PEOPLE The biggest advantage of 𝕏 is reach where it actually matters If you want to get in front of senior decision-makers and the people shaping the world, this is where they are Not trend-chasing influencers, but the people who run companies, shape policy, write ideas, and move markets The people with real authority and impact Whether it’s Marc Andreessen or other top thinkers and leaders, 𝕏 is often the only place to reach them directly They are not watching TV. They are not making TikTok videos While 𝕏 may be smaller than other social platforms in total users, it concentrates the highest density of influence That is what makes it powerful - ELON MUSK</description>

      <link>https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/24036690</link>
      <description>Agency &gt; Intelligence I had this intuitively wrong for decades, I think due to a pervasive cultural veneration of intelligence, various entertainment/media, obsession with IQ etc. Agency is significantly more powerful and significantly more scarce. Are you hiring for agency? Are we educating for agency? Are you acting as if you had 10X agency? Grok explanation is ~close: “Agency, as a personality trait, refers to an individual's capacity to take initiative, make decisions, and exert control over their actions and environment. It’s about being proactive rather than reactive—someone with high agency doesn’t just let life happen to them; they shape it. Think of it as a blend of self-efficacy, determination, and a sense of ownership over one’s path. People with strong agency tend to set goals and pursue them with confidence, even in the face of obstacles. They’re the type to say, “I’ll figure it out,” and then actually do it. On the flip side, someone low in agency might feel more like a passenger in their own life, waiting for external forces—like luck, other people, or circumstances—to dictate what happens next. It’s not quite the same as assertiveness or ambition, though it can overlap. Agency is quieter, more internal—it’s the belief that you *can* act, paired with the will to follow through. Psychologists often tie it to concepts like locus of control: high-agency folks lean toward an internal locus, feeling they steer their fate, while low-agency folks might lean external, seeing life as something that happens *to* them.”</description>

      <description>This is because California’s state and local politicians have completely broken LA and the state in general. It is increasingly untenable to do business: - Too many permits - Too many laws - Too much overreach - Too many delays - Too many taxes It’s killed Hollywood and it’s coming for Silicon Valley next. The difference is that Silicon Valley can move. Hollywood just sat by while the government and party they blindly supported gutted their industry. We won’t.</description>

      <description>No civilization is perfectly level. Therefore, either a civilization is expanding or contracting. Collapsing birth rates mean that most cultures are tending towards extinction! Expanding is the only option for those who want LIfE, for those who CARE about the FUTURE.</description>
