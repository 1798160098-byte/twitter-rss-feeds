      <description>Here it is: USAID not only facilitated the overthrow of foreign countries, but also operations here at home: Barack Obama covertly funneled $1.2 billion through USAID that was supposedly designated for Pakistan as “humanitarian aid,” but instead laundered it through the Cayman Islands to help overthrow the Cuban government. Similarly, USAID funneled $27 million to the “rent-a-riots” terrorist group Black Lives Matter through the Tides Foundation—a George Soros–backed terrorist organization—which helped overthrow the United States government leading up to the 2020 presidential election. Here is:@MikeBenzCyberdiscussing how Obama funded a social media platform—a Twitter clone—that was used to push propaganda in Cuba, inspire protests, and then leverage that funding to train and deploy “rent-a-riots” for protests aimed at overthrowing governments. Mike Benz: “A scandal during the Obama USAID era. We were running a number of rogue USAID operations in Cuba at the time. USAID pumped $1.2 billion in, and we sponsored these activist groups and these civil society organizations to learn how to use Facebook, learn how to use Twitter, learn how to use hashtags, and learn how to coordinate street protests so that everyone knew where to go, which streets to show up on, and what slogans to use in order to create the pro-democracy predicate for it. You’re using Cayman Islands bank accounts. You’re saying it’s earmarked for Pakistani aid. But the money was never sent to Pakistan—it was sent to the Cayman Islands to fund this whole operation.”</description>

      <description>Starlink had an amazing year in 2025, and 2026 is looking to be even crazier. They added 38 new regions, doubled their active customers, added 270 Tbps of capacity and reached other milestones like completing the V1 of the D2C network. 2 days ago, they released their annual "Starlink Progress Report". This 75 page long PDF contains a lot of information, and is super interesting to read. Here is a thread that summarizes everything.</description>

      <description>Why is the Overton windows shifting so fast right now? Because it was hold back by force. If your surpress a organic debate with censorship and violence, it will explode, as soon as people lose fear. We are no longer afraid. Your time is over.</description>

      <description>“Some people out there may be somewhat skeptical. They may think, well, there isn't some Democrat plan to subvert democracy and achieve a permanent one-party, deep blue socialist state. I assure you, the more you research it, the more you will see it is true.” Elon Musk</description>

      <description>ELON: CIVILIZATIONS FREEZE WHEN RULES NEVER GET DELETED Legislative gridlock paralyze innovation. Using an analogy from Gulliver’s Travels, Elon argued that the U.S. has become a giant pinned to the ground and not by one massive chain, but by "a million little strings" of regulations that make even the simplest progress illegal. Thankfully for the U.S., DOGE isn't just an advisory body; it’s the "garbage collection" function required to prevent the "hardening of the arteries" of America “There’s a thing that happens over time with any civilization. Laws and regulations just accumulate. If there isn’t some forcing function to clean them up, eventually everything becomes illegal. It’s like hardening of the arteries, or being tied down by a million little strings. No single string is the problem. It’s all of them together. There has to be a kind of garbage collection for laws and regulations. Otherwise you just keep adding rules until nothing can move. That’s why big projects stop happening. It’s not that people forgot how to build. It’s that it becomes illegal six ways from Sunday to do anything.” Source:@teslaownersSV</description>

      <description>Straight to the Point: Independent Journalism Will Dominate 2026 How CBS Executives Blocked The Hunter Biden Story "When we did the story, we did it after the (2022) midterms. I argued against that because it was ready before the midterms and my training is that you should always do the story when it's ready to go. You should not be dictated by the political cycle." At that time, CBS News was under different management, and did not respond to our questions seeking comment.@thelatmg@latimes</description>
