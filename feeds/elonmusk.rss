      <description>now that we're calculating net worth as "control," I'd like to remind you ro khanna is 1 of 535 united states legislators. that gives him around .19% control of a $6.3 trillion budget, and brings his net worth to something like $12 billion. his tax bill: $598,500,000.</description>

      <description>UPDATE: It’s worse than we thought. In October, we flagged $1.3 billion in Medicaid funds that 6 states may have unlawfully spent on health care for illegal immigrants. Since then, we’ve gathered more data and the total has grown to over $1.8 billion across 8 states. It’s against the law to spend federal Medicaid funds on non-emergency healthcare for illegals. If states use their own money to do it, there needs to be a clear paper trail proving that federal dollars didn’t fund those services. These states failed to provide that for this $1.8 billion. So today, CMS is announcing that we’re withholding nearly $300 million from California — which is by far the worst offender — until they demonstrate to our satisfaction that they’re spending that money properly. Medicaid dollars belong to Americans, not illegal immigrants, and we won’t stop until we’ve held rogue states accountable and recovered their misspent funds. More announcements to come.</description>

      <description>NEWS: SpaceX's Starlink is upgrading its cheapest, $50-per-month plan by doubling the amount of monthly data from 50GB to 100GB for no additional cost. The Roam 100GB plan can also continue offering satellite internet access, even after the data cap is exceeded. The connection will just be downgraded to speeds under 1Mbps, or what SpaceX calls “unlimited low-speed data.” In contrast, the original Roam 50GB plan required users to pay for additional data at rate of $1 per GB, otherwise SpaceX would cut off the access for the rest of the month.</description>

      <description>Note: With NSFW enabled, Grok is supposed allow upper body nudity of imaginary adult humans (not real ones) consistent with what can be seen in R-rated movies on Apple TV. That is the de facto standard in America. This will vary in other regions according to the laws on a country by country basis.</description>

      <description>Anger in Sweden after the news that the rapist knows as “The Mine Shaft Afghan” is already being granted leave from prison. In 2022, he raped a woman and pushed her down a 24 meter deep mine shaft before throwing bricks on her body. She survived somehow. Taher Amini, who was sentenced to life in prison, has been granted leave from prison. The decision has been made despite the risk of recidivism in sexual offenses being assessed as high. Taher Amini was sentenced to life imprisonment and deportation for aggravated rape and attempted murder following the high-profile incident in the spring of 2022. The woman survived after lying severely injured in a 24-meter-deep mine shaft for a day before she was found by passersby. According to the court, Amini attacked the woman after she rejected his demand for marriage. He raped and assaulted her and then pushed her down the mine shaft. While she was still alive, he threw bricks down at her. Amini has been granted permission for what is known as a “lufthålspermission” (short “fresh air” leave). During the leave, he is, among other things, allowed to visit a restaurant, go to a bookstore and spend time in a shopping center. Documents show that this is not the first time Amini has been granted leave. The decision to grant him these leaves has sparked significant public controversy due to the severity of the crime and the high assessed risk of sexual recidivism.</description>

      <description>America is 4% of world population, but illegals can scam money from the government that is higher than 95% of Earth and more than most Americans make! America would be swamped, go bankrupt and then cease to exist at all if illegal immigration enforcement were to be defunded.</description>
