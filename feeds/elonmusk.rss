      <description>Nearly one Houstonian EVERY 10 DAYS is murdered by a repeat felon released back onto the streets. That is unacceptable in Texas. We must use and expand every tool available to remove recalcitrant DAs and keep violent criminals off our streets.</description>

      <description>AUSTIN MAN pulled up to a 7-Eleven at 3 a.m., shot a father of five dead in the parking lot, and drove off. Caleb Jenkins now faces murder charges. But prosecutors had chances to stop him. November 2023: Jenkins, a convicted felon, was caught with a firearm. DA José Garza's office declined to prosecute. No charges filed. That same month: arrested for assault causing bodily injury/family violence. He skipped court. Bond was forfeited. Warrant issued. Re-arrested. Bond increased again. That case is still pending, two-plus years later. August 2024: caught with over four ounces of marijuana. DA declined again. No charges filed. October 2025: Quinton Arnold is dead in a 7-Eleven parking lot. Jenkins' record since 2012: • 3 gun charges — 2 days jail total • Felon caught with firearm — DA passed • 2 family violence assaults — dismissed or deferred • Protective order violation — dismissed • Multiple marijuana charges — dismissed or declined • Skipped court repeatedly across multiple cases A felon with a gun. Prosecutors said pass. Now there's a dead body.</description>

      <description>I did a lot of moaning and groaning about my husband getting a cyber truck but the self-driving feature is completely life changing. Call me a convert. I’ve never felt so safe in a car. Putting my kids in any other car feels reckless by comparison</description>

      <description>In 2023, at the Cybertruck Delivery Event, Tesla said that they would launch a RWD Cybertruck with a 250 mile range for $61k Today, they launched an AWD Cybertruck for $60k with 325 miles of range, 4.1s 0-60, outlets and tonneau for even less than they said the RWD would be. Cheaper, more range, AWD, and quicker. Count inflation and the current new AWD price near matches the ones shown in 2019 too.</description>
