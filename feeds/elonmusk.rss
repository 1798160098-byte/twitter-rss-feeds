      <description>"We're all fucked!" Rioter signal chat was exposed for all their internal plans targetting ICE agents (names, threats, illegal acts). Now they panic, talk about fleeing the state, or country.</description>

      <description>Wait… Grok actually watches your videos now? 🤯 Ran an analysis on my post about MrBeast &amp; Starship heat shield tiles, &amp; the details Grok gave me - including the tile’s weight and serial number, came straight from the video itself! That means Grok isn’t just reading text anymore… it’s watching 👀 Seeing AI evolve in real time like this is honestly surreal and xAI is doing something really special here 👏🏻xcancel.com/i/grok/share/1d79953ab…</description>

      <description>A central preoccupation of the “censorship-industrial complex” (NGOs + their govt principals) was the creation of a de facto DSA / OSA regime in the United States. Compare, eg, DSA “trusted flagger” structure with the prioritized “content moderation” channels seen in Murthy.</description>

      <link>https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/e625b063</link>
      <description>Elon Musk's answer to the question of why he continues to work for the benefit of humanity, being such a rich man: “Certainly there are times when I have doubts about these things... It's a good question because it goes at a foundational level: what is my philosophy, and why does it lead to this conclusion? So the reason is that when I was a teenager, I had, like, an existential crisis to try to figure out what's the meaning of life. There doesn't seem to be any meaning. For me, at least the religious texts, and I read all of them that I could get my hands on, did not seem convincing. Then I started reading the philosophers. Be careful of reading German philosophers as a teenager. It's definitely not going to help with your depression. So, reading Schopenhauer, Nietzsche as an adult, it's much more manageable. But as a kid, you're like, 'Whoa.' So then I was like, 'Man, I'm just struggling to find meaning in life here.' And then I read Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy. And basically what Douglas Adams was saying is that we don't really know what the right questions are to ask. The question is not, 'What's the meaning of life?' In The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, Earth, it turns out, is a big computer, and its goal is to answer the question, 'What's the meaning of life?' And Earth comes up with the answer '42'. This is where the 42 number comes from. And 420 is just ten times 42. In that book, which is really sort of a book about, it's an existential philosophy book disguised as humor. They come to the conclusion that the real problem is trying to formulate the question. And to really have the right question, you need a much bigger computer than Earth. And so maybe one way, I think, of characterizing this would be to say, 'The universe is the answer. What is the question? Or what are the questions?' The more we can expand the scope and scale of consciousness, the better we can understand what questions to ask about the answer that is the universe. The more we can expand consciousness, become a multi-planet species, ultimately a multistellar species… we have a chance of figuring out what the hell is going on. And so this is why I think we should have more humans and both biological and digital consciousness. And why we should become a multi-planet species and a multistellar species is so that we can understand the nature of the universe. And then, in order for that to occur, then we have to make sure that things are good on Earth. We don't want Earth to disappear, so sustainable energy is important.”</description>
