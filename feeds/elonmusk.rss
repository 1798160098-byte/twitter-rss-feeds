      <description>STARLINK CRUSHES RIVALS WITH 97% OF SPEED TESTS! 🔥 Among the global speed tests gathered by Ookla in Q3, 97.1% came from@Starlink, with Viasat at a distant second with 1.7% and HughesNet at 1%. Ookla’s report offers an interesting snapshot of Starlink’s performance worldwide. In the US, the median download speeds have been improving, reaching 117Mbps, up from 61.7Mbps in 2022 when Starlink faced more user congestion due to its popularity. The speeds have also increased noticeably in Canada, where the median download rate has reached 111Mbps, up from 79Mbps a year earlier.@elonmusk</description>

      <description>Elon Musk on Politics: "Politics generally is very tribal, and people lose their objectivity, usually with politics like they generally have trouble seeing the good on the other side or the bad in their own side. This was one of the things that surprised me the most that you often simply cannot reason with people if they're in one tribe or the other. They simply believe that everything their tribe does is good and anything the other political tribe does is bad."</description>

      <description>🚨NEW:@elonmusk🐼 "What I discovered is it's extremely difficult even to cut very obvious waste and fraud from the government — because the government has to operate on who's complaining." "If you cut off payments to fraudsters, they immediately come up with the most sympathetic sounding reasons to continue the payment. They don't say, 'Please keep the fraud going.' They’re like, 'You're killing baby pandas!' "Meanwhile, there's no baby pandas who are dying. They're just making it up. The fraudsters are capable of coming up with extremely compelling, heart-wrenching stories that are false — but nonetheless sound sympathetic. That's what happened."@DailyCaller</description>

      <description>Republicans in Indiana took the "high road" and didn’t redraw 2 Democratic seats in a state that Trump won by +19 pts. Democrats in Virginia took power and are immediately eliminating 4 Republican seats in a state Kamala barely won by +5 pts. There’s a powerful lesson here.</description>
