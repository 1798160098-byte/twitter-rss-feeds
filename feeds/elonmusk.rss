      <description>I’ve researched so many founders and CEOs in my lifetime bc it’s the most important thing when it comes to investing. And I’ve realized more and more that the difference between Elon and most founders or CEOs is very simple and super rare. Many CEOs lead and give orders from an ivory tower, while Elon is always and willing to fight in the trenches with his people. While many CEOs give orders from a far, Elon is hands on with everything at Tesla. He’s on the factory floor. In the engineering and design room. In uncomfortable situations and makes the tough decisions. On top of this, he directly uses the products him and the team builds first hand and is wiling to put his heath and life at risk in doing so. I remember when he was willing to risk arrest during COVID rather than shut down what his team was fighting to build. He put his own freedom on the line because he believed in the mission and in the people behind it. “Tesla is restarting production today against Alameda County rules. I will be on the line with everyone else. If anyone is arrested, I ask that it only be me.” - Elon Musk This kind of leadership is different. When your CEO is willing to take the hits for the team, sleep on the factory floor, and personally stand in front of the fire, it creates trust that he will NEVER let Tesla fail. Real leaders don’t hide, they step forward, as one.</description>

      <description>If your CEO is literally riding in the passenger seat while the car drives itself around a major U.S. city, with no safety monitor in the vehicle, that’s about as bullish of a signal you can send to the market that autonomy is here and Tesla has solved it. This is Elon Musk, in Austin, letting Tesla’s AI do 100% of the work, confident enough in the technology to remove the last human supervision inside the vehicle. What honesty makes this moment special to me is how long it’s been coming. Tesla first talked about full autonomy back in 2016, when FSD was introduced as a long-term software promise. Since then, we’ve had • years of real world data collection • multiple hardware generations • vision only going against industry consensus of LiDAR • endless doubt and skepticism, delays, and “it’ll never work” headlines This is nearly a decade of hard work and intelligent iterations to reach this moment. When the person with the most to lose is willing to trust the system with his own life, this debate now ends overnight. We’ve been waiting for this day for almost 10 years… Elon may not always be on time, may be very optimistic at times, but he and his team always delivers. Damn, it feels good to be a retail Tesla investor.</description>

      <description>The easy ability to call@grokon twitter is probably the biggest thing after community notes that has been positive for the truth-friendliness of this platform. The fact that you don't see ahead of time how grok will respond is key here - I've seen many situations where someone calls on grok expecting their crazy political belief to be confirmed and grok comes along and rugs them.</description>

      <description>GROK STAYS AHEAD OF THE CURVE: ACING ALL TESTS KNOWN TO MAN It's not just the smartest LLM, it's the world's most psychologically advanced AI model. * Grok scored 98/100 openness and agreeableness: the most “human” AI ever built * Tops empathy benchmarks with 95% EQ accuracy and 92% success in emotion detection * Leads in Theory of Mind, predicting beliefs and intentions better than any rival model * Scored 148 on the Mensa IQ test: top 0.1% human equivalent * Elon: “Grok isn’t just smart, it’s empathetic, the AI that understands you” This isn't 'artificial' intelligence; it's the birth of another intelligent species.
