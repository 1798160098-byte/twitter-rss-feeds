      <description>Elon Musk inspires us. He wants us to wake up in the morning feeling that the future is going to be great, and that’s what being a spacefaring civilization is all about. It’s about inspiring people to think about the stars. ✨</description>

      <description>We do not want allies shackled by guilt and shame. We want allies who are proud of their culture and heritage and are willing to help us defend it.</description>

      <description>It would seem that 14 year old girls are not learning in 8th sex-ed class that if they transition to a boy that they will experience vaginal dryness and pelvic floor collapse and never give birth vaginally as adults. I will stop posting these when this madness ends.</description>

      <description>For a country to survive, there has to be a common culture. Nobody dies to defend a “multicultural economic zone”! American culture, with its English-Scotts-Irish origin, is great and worth fighting for. Some may not realize it, but that’s why people come here. 🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸</description>

      <description>If C.S. Lewis had been asked by radical Senate Democrats to defend "British Culture" and why it matters, this is what he would have said: "A man’s reasons for not wanting his country to be ruled by foreigners are very like his reasons for not wanting his house to be burned down; because he could not even begin to enumerate all the things he would miss."</description>

      <description>I used to be opposed to death penalty, because I figured we’re wealthy, we can afford incarceration, and what if we get the wrong guy? Two things changed my mind: 1. Actually looking at actual death penalty cases 2. Realizing how many progressives want to set murderers free</description>

      <description>Crew-12 is now aboard the@Space_Station, advancing research, discovery, and operational excellence in the demanding environment of low-Earth orbit. Human spaceflight is a major team effort and requires immense competence, precision and discipline.

      <description>This is true. Every time I visited Elon, his kids were with him. They spend time together, just being a family. It is not only at home. He also brings his kids with him to work sometimes so he can spend more time with them. Even during his meeting with Prime Minister Modi, his kids were with him. That says a lot about his priorities. He makes space for family time even with a busy schedule. He is a great father. But the media often creates stories and narratives about him that do not match reality. Do not believe everything you see in the news. A lot of coverage is driven by negativity, clicks, and attention rather than truth.</description>
