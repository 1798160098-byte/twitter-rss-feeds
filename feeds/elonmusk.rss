      <link>https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/6ee44edf</link>
      <description>In just two months, 🇭🇺 Hungary will hold parliamentary elections. And now it is official: the Brussels elite has been systematically interfering in European elections for years — through digital censorship. This is not an opinion, but a documented fact: according to documents released by 🇺🇲@JudiciaryGOP, the European Commission, invoking the Digital Services Act (DSA), compelled social media platforms to suppress political content deemed inconvenient for the ruling elite ahead of elections. The Commission did not target illegal content. It sought to restrict lawful, legitimate political speech, including: 🔸️ narratives branded by them as “populist” 🔸️ EU-critical and elite-critical positions 🔸️ migration-critical views 🔸️ content critical of gender ideology 🔸️ political satire &amp; memes 👉 These are, after all, exactly the issues on which Hungary’s patriotic government has drawn a clear red line against Brussels for years, and in which it consistently prevents the Brussels elite from interfering in Hungary’s sovereign national decisions. Election interference through digital censorship was already carried out in the 🇳🇱 Netherlands. In 🇷🇴 Romania as well. And in 🇸🇰 Slovakia. Altogether, in eight (❗️) elections across six European countries. ⚠️ There is therefore no reason to believe that similar measures were not planned ahead of Hungary’s upcoming parliamentary elections. The overall picture is clear. Today, there is one serious obstacle standing in the way of Brussels and Kyiv carrying out their pro-war agenda without resistance: 🇭🇺Hungary’s patriotic government. A government that rejects escalation, refuses to make Hungarian families pay the price of war, and says no to new taxes and austerity measures. The objective of the Brussels elite is therefore clear: a change of government in Budapest. This is not even a hidden intention. 👉 Manfred Weber, President of the European People’s Party — the political force backing Ursula von der Leyen — is openly campaigning for Péter Magyar and his Tisza Party, the main challengers to the patriotic governing parties, Fidesz–KDNP. Their goal is to install a Brussels- and Ukraine-friendly government, one that will unquestioningly carry out instructions — whether on migration, gender ideology, war, tax hikes, or austerity measures. In light of the documents now made public, the conclusion is unmistakable: digital censorship is not an isolated phenomenon, but a political instrument, deployed where voters’ decisions do not guarantee the desired outcome. But#Hungary’s election is not a Brussels project‼️ It will not be decided by foreign campaigns, algorithms, or political pressure. The right to decide belongs to the Hungarian people — and we will not give that up.</description>

      <description>The Epstein files is a Democrat hoax perpetuated on the American people. Why didn’t Bill Clinton, Reid Hoffman, or Bill Gates push for Epstein’s arrest or prosecutions of serious wrongdoings by their friends during Obama or Biden years? In President Trump’s first term, Jeffrey Epstein was arrested and jailed. In his second, he’s released the files. It’s curious why didn’t these Democrats want Justice before?</description>

      <description>If anyone did everything within their power to put pressure on the Department of Justice to release the Jeffrey Epstein files, it was@elonmuskElon pushed harder than anyone for the release of the Jeffrey Epstein files. Thank you, Elon, for standing against child trafficking. Sound of freedom.</description>

      <description>He makes a good point. Saying this about any other race would be condemned immediately and should be. So why is it not incredibly racist and wrong to say this about Whites?</description>

      <description>Grok v/s ChatGPT Grok pulls real-time info from current events, while ChatGPT has no clue about real-time events. When asked about Billie Eilish's recent Grammys speech, ChatGPT had no clue about her recent speech at all &amp; kept talking about her 2020 speech. Grok is real-time.</description>
