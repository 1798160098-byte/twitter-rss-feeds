      <description>🇺🇸 THE CENSUS LOOPHOLE LETTING POLITICIANS IMPORT CONGRESSIONAL SEATS Here's a math problem that should terrify every American: California gets extra House seats because of people who can't legally vote, while Ohio loses representation because it follows immigration law. The Census counts 11-15 million undocumented immigrants for congressional apportionment, giving sanctuary states bonus political power at everyone else's expense. The mechanics are devastating. States with large undocumented populations get congressional seats and electoral votes, while law-abiding states lose influence. Current estimates show this affects 3-5 House seats, potentially reaching 17 by 2030. Politicians can literally import political power by encouraging illegal immigration. Think about the perverse incentives. Why should a citizen in Indiana have their voice diminished because California ignores federal immigration law? Every undocumented immigrant counted for apportionment dilutes legal citizens' votes everywhere else. We're rewarding lawbreaking with increased political power while punishing law-abiding states with reduced representation. The Founders never imagined cities openly defying federal law to pad census numbers. The solution is simple: count only citizens for congressional apportionment. This is about ensuring representation reflects actual voters, not whoever happens to be physically present. Fix this loophole before the next census makes the distortion permanent.

      <description>The census loophole is a sovereignty issue, not just a math problem. Sanctuary states gaming the system by counting non-citizens for apportionment undermines the principle of "one person, one vote" for actual taxpayers. H.R.7109 - the Equal Representation Act - fixes this by mandating citizenship verification, ensuring congressional seats reflect legal voters rather than illegal entries. While some studies claim minimal impact, they ignore the compounding effect: every seat gained through demographic manipulation lets politicians redirect billions in federal funds to maintain their power base. California's 2.1 million undocumented residents didn't just "happen" to be there - they're the result of decades of deliberate non-enforcement. The real cost? Law-abiding states lose infrastructure grants, healthcare resources, and political clout. This isn't about partisanship - it's about preventing foreign nationals from dictating America's legislative agenda through proxy representation. Fix the census, restore weight to citizens' votes.</description>

      <description>The reason that all liberal insults fail to land is because everybody can see clearly that they won’t follow those insults to their logical conclusion. So, for example, a liberal will call somebody who very clearly has, like, an 85th percentile IQ a complete fucking moron, but they would never say that about dumb kids in failing schools, who they imagine to be just a few more dollars away from careers as astronauts The liberal will call some morally average working guy a “bad person” but on the other hand the violent degenerate on his 50th arrest just needs our help. In this you can see that it is for them merely a status game and they’re only concerned about status with respect to people who they see as status rivals.</description>

It’s not a coincidence the quality of life went down after the Somali gangs started a drug turf war using hand grenades. Calling it racist doesn’t solve the problem.”</description>
