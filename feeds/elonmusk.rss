      <description>ELON MUSK: Over 1 billion people use 𝕏. "The reason we say 1 billion users is actually over a billion users is that while our monthly users are, on average, around 600 million, the number of people who have the X app installed is well over a billion, it's just that most people only occasionally come to the X app when there's some major world event. But as we give people more reasons to use the X app, whether it's for communications, for Grok or for X money, whatever the case may be, we want it to be such that, if you wanted to, you could live your life on the X app, and as we make it more and more useful, we'll obviously give people compelling reasons to use the app every day, and have my expectation is well over a billion daily active users."</description>

      <description>For all the fools that said 𝕏 would be dead by now.… here are the facts the team just shared at the xAI all hands. • New users spend +43% more time in-app (all-time high) • Existing users spend +20% more time (all-time high) • Downloads are up +60% (all-time high) • Subscriptions crossed $1 billion (all-time high) • 120 million downloads per month (achieved 3 consecutive record months) • Highest all-time engagement in January, on track to beat it in February RIP to all the doubters.</description>

      <description>Elon Musk in new presentation: "I really want to see a mass driver on the Moon that is shooting AI satellites into deep space. I can't image anything more epic than a mass driver on the Moon, a self-sustaining city on the Moon, and then going to Mars, throughout our solar system, and ultimately being out there amongst the stars and visiting all these star systems. Maybe we'll meet aliens."</description>

      <description>This should be the 1 congressional priority: &gt; in 15 states, you don't have to show **any** ID to vote &gt; 69% of liberal voters support photo ID requirements, but only one democratic senator has voted for the Save Act &gt; either voter ID is mandated now, or, whenever the senate next flips, the opposite will happen (mandated no-ID voting across the US) If the bill doesn't pass now, it would be an absolute disaster for electoral security, and would likely essentially create a permanent one-party state Huge bi-partisan support. It's just a common-sense requirement. The bill is stuck due to the zombie filibuster - where the minority can refuse to vote, without even standing and talking End the filibuster and pass the bill!</description>

      <description>🚨NEW: Elon Musk explains the reason behind the SpaceX and xAI merger. "In order to understand the universe, you must explore the universe. That's the motivation behind the combination of SpaceX and xAI is to accelerate humanity's future in understanding the universe and extending the light of consciousness to the stars. So in the grand scheme of things, when you look at how much energy Earth is actually using for civilization, we're only right now using, call it roughly 1% of the potential energy of Earth. And if we wanted to use even a millionth of the sun's energy, that would be roughly a million times more energy than civilization currently uses. The only way to access that energy, the energy of the sun is to extend beyond Earth. Earth is really a tiny, tiny dust Mote in a vast darkness. The sun is 99.8% of all mass in the solar system, so you have to expand beyond the tiny dust mode that is earth to make any significant dent in using the sun's energy like says, you'd have to expand roughly a million times just to get to 1,000,000th of our sun's energy, and then going beyond that, exploring extending to the Galaxy. So the the next step beyond Earth data centers is our Earth orbital data centers, and we'll be launching with SpaceX orbital data centers at the 100 to 200 gigawatt per year level, not cumulative, I mean, per year. And ultimately, we see a path to maybe launching as much as a terawatt per year of compute from Earth."</description>

      <description>Milton Friedman on 4 ways to spend money: 1) Your money on yourself (you’re careful about both cost and quality) 2) Your money on others (you care about cost, less about quality) 3) Someone else’s money on yourself (you care about quality, not cost) 4) Someone else’s money on others (you care about neither) The last one is how government spending works</description>

      <description>Dems are calling requiring Voter ID “racist” and “Jim Crow 2.0”. Some Black populations of countries that require Voter ID to vote: Haiti: 95% Jamaica: 92% Kenya: 99% Ghana: 99% Botswana: 90% South Africa: 81% Brazil: 56% I wonder if they know theyre racist towards themselves?</description>

      <description>xAI was reorganized a few days ago to improve speed of execution. As a company grows, especially as quickly as xAI, the structure must evolve just like any living organism. This unfortunately required parting ways with some people. We wish them well in future endeavors. We are hiring aggressively. Join xAI if the idea of mass drivers on the Moon appeals to you.</description>
