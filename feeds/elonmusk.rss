      <description>This is from a 2018 Minnesota criminal prosecution against Somali daycare fraudsters. In surveillance video, Somali parents would take their kids to the daycare, check them in, and then leave with them moments later. The owners of the daycare would then bill the state for a full day of childcare-- and give the parents kickback payments for being in on the fraud. Somali fraudsters have been stealing from taxpayers for years and it's clear that the entire Somali community is in on it.</description>

      <description>I have some bad news. If you are rightfully upset about the daycare fraud in Minnesota, it is only 1 program. There are 14 programs identified as high risk by federal prosecutors. These are being called the “fraudy 14” 1. Adult Companion Services 2. Adult Day Services 3. Adult Rehabilitative Mental Health Services 4. Assertive Community Treatment 5.

      <description>DHS is on the ground in Minneapolis, going DOOR TO DOOR at suspected fraud sites. The American people deserve answers on how their taxpayer money is being used and ARRESTS when abuse is found. Under the leadership of@Sec_Noem, DHS is working to deliver results.</description>

      <description>For years, people attacked Elon Musk over government contracts won by SpaceX....... contracts that saved taxpayers billions and literally rescued U.S. spaceflight Yet those same people never ask: • Where did the $13-15B go on California’s invisible high-speed rail? • Why is there silence on $1B+ daycare fraud by Somalis in Minnesota? • Other 100s of Billions in Fraud Let’s be clear..... If not for Elon, the U.S. would’ve been begging Russia or China to reach the ISS NASA gave Boeing $4.2B SpaceX got $2.6B Here are the result: • SpaceX: Years of successful crew &amp; cargo missions • Boeing: Years late, budget overruns, and stranded astronauts..... SpaceX had to step in Today, SpaceX handles ~90% of the world’s payload to orbit For comparison: • Space Shuttle: 135 missions in 30 years • SpaceX: 165+ Falcon 9 missions in 2025 SpaceX earned those contracts because no one else could do the job....... and did it cheaper, faster, and safer And while some people cry about contracts, Elon is pushing US forward in: • Space • EVs • Manufacturing • AI • Energy Without Elon, U.S. would be behind China in all of it Think about that...</description>

      <description>It’s not just the Somalis in Minnesota. The Dems opened up our nation to anyone who would come here and vote for them, in exchange for our tax dollars. They use shell companies to funnel public money to the immigrants, meaning we are slaves that fund the people replacing us. This is why the Dems so desperately don’t want voter ID. Because they are wittingly engaged in a scheme to let the illegals vote, which allows them to stay in power, which allows them to continue to steal our tax dollars. It’s all one giant racket, an We the People are the suckers.</description>
