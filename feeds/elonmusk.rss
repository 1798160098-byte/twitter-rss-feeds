      <description>My friend’s cousin recently went out in Milan and ended up at an afterparty. What began as a normal night quickly turned into a nightmare. A group of Somalis held him against his will, took all of his belongings, and threatened him. They forced him to log into his accounts and transfer all of his money and cryptocurrency. He was threatened with knives and guns and genuinely believed he was going to die. In the end, he fought back and managed to escape, knowing they might kill him, but feeling it was his only chance. I have never heard of something remotely like this happening to someone in my social sphere before third-world mass immigration to Europe.</description>

Not at all… and I’ve been here since 2017!” “They’re stealing the money!” He even called on Tim Walz to be JAILED over this. I agree! 🎥@nickshirleyy</description>

      <description>🇨🇳 TESLA MODEL Y FALLS OFF 800-METER CLIFF IN CHINA... DRIVER WALKS AWAY This is absolutely insane. A Tesla Model Y plunged off an approximately 800-meter cliff in China, tumbling down a mountainside. The vehicle was completely destroyed, windows shattered, body mangled beyond recognition. But the A- and B-pillars held. The passenger cabin didn't collapse. The battery didn't ignite. The driver suffered only minor injuries. Rescue crews had to dismantle the wreckage to recover the vehicle. Local reports are calling it a "miracle of survival." This is what happens when a car is engineered with safety as a priority, not an afterthought. Tesla's rigid structural design and low center of gravity from the battery placement aren't just marketing points. They're the reason this driver is alive. 800 meters is over 2,600 feet. That's not a fender bender. That's falling off a mountain. Most vehicles would have become a coffin. The Model Y became a survival pod. Source:@elonmusk/@ray4tesla</description>

      <description>OPINION: ANTI-WHITE HATE CRIMES ARE RISING, AND THE MEDIA DOESN’T WANT YOU TO NOTICE In Hawaii, 2 guys beat a white man with a shovel for moving into their village. Told him, “No white man is ever going to live here.” Hate crime, right? Took a federal case just to admit it. In 2024, most racial hate crime victims in Massachusetts were white. Some will downplay it, but that’s state data. Don't expect to hear it on cable news, though. During 2020 and 2021, anti-white hate crimes hit their highest numbers in years, right when media was busy blaming whiteness for everything wrong in America. Coincidence? Sure, and I’ve got a bridge to sell you. The media cherry-picks outrage. If the victim’s white and the motive is racial, the story disappears. Hate is hate... unless it messes with the narrative, of course. Source: propublica, bjs, bostonherald,</description>
