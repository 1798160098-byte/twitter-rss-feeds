      <description>I used to be opposed to death penalty, because I figured we’re wealthy, we can afford incarceration, and what if we get the wrong guy? Two things changed my mind: 1. Actually looking at actual death penalty cases 2. Realizing how many progressives want to set murderers free</description>

      <description>Crew-12 is now aboard the@Space_Station, advancing research, discovery, and operational excellence in the demanding environment of low-Earth orbit. Human spaceflight is a major team effort and requires immense competence, precision and discipline.

      <description>This is true. Every time I visited Elon, his kids were with him. They spend time together, just being a family. It is not only at home. He also brings his kids with him to work sometimes so he can spend more time with them. Even during his meeting with Prime Minister Modi, his kids were with him. That says a lot about his priorities. He makes space for family time even with a busy schedule. He is a great father. But the media often creates stories and narratives about him that do not match reality. Do not believe everything you see in the news. A lot of coverage is driven by negativity, clicks, and attention rather than truth.</description>

      <description>This is literally true. Editing Wikipedia was a major for-credit assignment in a Berkeley "Studies" course. As a Wokist might say: "Don't automatically assume you're just imagining things."</description>

      <description>Wilberforce, and people like him, ended the global slave trade that had existed for several thousand years. They didn’t invent it, but they did stop it. I should say almost entirely. There are still remnants of it in some parts of the world.</description>

      <description>I remember when@JohnCleesewas a devout Liberal Democrat. He declined a peerage, which was a pity because he'd have been a formidable presence in the House of Lords. His political journey is fascinating. Indeed, it merits a doctoral thesis (which I'd be happy to supervise).</description>

      <description>If black and brown people can be proud of their races, why not whites? If black and brown people can be indigenous and native, why not whites? It’s this lack of symmetry and equality that’s driving current resentments on all sides.</description>
