      <description>We need to seriously investigate Steve Bannon and his connection to Epstein. This guy was defending him way too hard. There is definitely something shady about it. Keep Bannon and his crew away from Trump at all costs.</description>

      <description>xAI added their new image generation model (grok-imagine-image-pro) to the API, so I had Grok build a simple webpage that lets you generate images from a text prompt. Here's what it looks like in action 👇 All you need is an xAI API key: → Go toconsole.x.ai→ Sign in / create an account → Add credits under billing → Generate an API key Open the link below, hit the preview button on the code to render the webpage inside Grok. Paste your key in, type a prompt, hit generate. That's it.grok.com/share/bGVnYWN5_493b…</description>

      <description>OMG. Jacob Frey and Tim Walz are responsible for releasing nearly 500 criminal illegal aliens back onto the streets instead of allowing ICE to pick them up. Democrats are actively protecting violent foreign criminals.</description>

      <description>🇬🇧 Rotherham: An 11-year-old girl who previously reported she was sexually abused was found in a derelict house with another girl and a group of adult males. She was arrested for drunken disorderly, and none of the males were arrested. Police officers dismissed a case where a 12-year-old girl was having sex with five Asian males as quote "100% consensual in every incident". Fathers have tracked down their daughters and tried to remove them from the houses where they were being abused only to find themselves arrested when police arrived to the scene. Home Affairs Committee 09 Sep 2014. Crompton retired with a £2m pension in 2016.</description>
