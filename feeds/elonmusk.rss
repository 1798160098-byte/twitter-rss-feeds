      <description>Try uploading a photo to Grok. It does a surprisingly good job analyzing images, and you can even upload your X rays or blood reports to Grok, and it will give you a medical diagnosis.</description>

      <description>exactly, this wasn't a janitor's sexist joke overheard in an elevator. these are this woman's stated beliefs. her whole identity. for years and years and years while she fought with people over these ideas online, and in public.</description>

      <description>I have no patience for racists in office who want to seize the house I saved for and bought solely due to the color of my skin. Anti-white racism is so normalized on the left that for most it doesn't even register as a problem, and is regularly wielded as a virtue signal.</description>

      <description>🚨WATCH: Here’s another angle of the woman trying to run over ICE agents in Minnesota. She was directly trying to run over the agent and was shot in self defense. Horrible situation, but when you turn your car into a weapon… what do you expect.</description>

      <description>ELON MUSK: “The homeless industrial complex in California is really dark, man. The network of NGOs should be called something like drug zombie farmers. Homeless is the wrong word. Homeless implies that somebody just got a little behind on their mortgage payments and that if they got a job offer, they would be back on their feet. But someone who is, I mean, you see these videos of people who are just shuffling around. They are on fentanyl. They are taking a dump in the middle of the street. They have open sores and stuff. They are not one drop off away from getting back on their feet, right? This is not homelessness. It is a propaganda word. San Francisco has this tax, this gross receipts tax. It is not even on revenue. It is on all transactions, which is why Stripe, Square, and many financial companies had to move out of San Francisco.”</description>

They want to try to kill their fellow citizens and that's a real problem."</description>

"It's almost shocking that you would have people running a daycare with a quality LEARING center!"@nickshirleyy🔥 "If you're running a daycare and you can't spell the word LEARNING or you can't spell the word KIDS, that suggests that maybe you should not be in early childhood education!"

      <description>That is exactly what they have been doing and it is sure to result in a one-party state, like California, but far worse. What holds back California, which is already a one-party supermajority state, from being far worse is that people can move to other states without leaving America. What do you think will happen when there is no escape?</description>
