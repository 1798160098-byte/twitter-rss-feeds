      <description>It seems this post went over the heads of some of the socialists, so let me put it as simply as possible: 1. If the US had not "given" (using Socialist jargon here) Musk $38b, they would have had to have "given" Boeing, Lockheed Martin and other "Aerospace" companies $78b (and they probably would not have been able to have got delivery the products &amp; services in time, or ever, anyway). 2. Elon Musk's companies deliver between $100b to $140b of taxes and added value to the US and it's citizens every year (more than the GDP of a small state), and these contributions are growing faster than the US economy every year. 3. To spell it out to the unbelievers, the US (and particularly Elon's 140,000 employees) is earning an enormous return from Elon Musk's wealth.</description>

      <description>Grok usage is exploding month over month, with people using it more than ever DAUs reached 6.12M in August 2025, then climbed to 10.17M over the last 28 days, a 66.2% increase This surge follows rapid rollouts of new features, stronger voice and vision capabilities, and growing daily use across the platforms</description>

      <description>This is What Winning Looks Like From Space Satellite imagery just caught xAI doing something no press release ever could: painting MACROHARD across the roof of its Colossus 2 datacenter in Tennessee. A building-sized wink at Microsoft, visible from orbit, impossible to ignore. It reads like a joke, until you look at what’s underneath. ⚆ Colossus 2 isn’t a concept site or a slide in a deck. Power and cooling infrastructure are expanding in lockstep, with the campus pushing toward ~400 MW of active capacity in the near term. Gas turbines are arriving. Cooling towers are multiplying. The build is loud because the progress is real. ⚆ More importantly, this early ramp sits on a much larger foundation. xAI has secured a clear path towards large scale on-site generation, creating a credible trajectory toward more than 2 GW of IT capacity over time. This isn’t aspirational: it’s ordered hardware, permitted infrastructure, and steel on the ground. The subtext is clear: while others debate timelines, this campus is already running. The roof says MACROHARD. The infrastructure says we’re ahead.</description>
