      <description>Only 34% of students in the Saint Paul School District are meeting grade-level reading standards. Maybe they should focus on teaching kids to read instead of teaching them how to protest for leftist causes</description>

      <description>The Singularity Part VIII: Kilowatts in Space Humanity needs power to survive and grow, and we will turn to the same source that all terrestrial life has relied upon: the Sun. Our star produces 3.828 × 10^{26} watts of power. This is enough to power all of humanity’s current needs for approximately 617,000 years. The Sun represents 99.86% of the mass of the solar system and virtually all of its energy potential. Seriously considering any other source is absurd. With cheap lift capacity rockets provided by@SpaceXStarship and virtually free raw materials from@Grok-controlled and@Tesla_Optimus-operated asteroid mines and space factories, humanity will finally be able to utilize a fraction of the Sun’s power. This harnessing of solar abundance will fuel the computational explosion driving the Singularity, powering AI minds and human expansion across the stars—unlocking potentials we can scarcely imagine today.</description>

      <description>American mother says her daughter is 1 of only 4 children in her entire math class that speaks English “She doesn't get to learn math because there's 20 plus other kids who don't know English and the teacher has to accommodate them” “Why am I paying property taxes? Why am I paying income tax? Why am I paying taxes for anything for my children to have a the right to a free and public education? — This this is what they get. You don't get to learn math because you know English, so you just don't get to learn math.”</description>

      <description>BREAKING: German courts just decided the Iraqi migrant who pushed 16-year-old Liana to her death in front of a train in Freidland will serve no prison time after he was determined to be suffering from “ill mental health”. Instead, he will spend time at a psychiatric facility at taxpayers' expense, and will not be deported. "Due to a diagnosis of schizophrenia, the accused was deemed not criminally responsible at the time of the offense," prosecutors stated. (Source@RMXnews)</description>

      <description>"California’s wealth tax is only on billionaires!" That’s how the income tax started too. Only for the ~1%… until it wasn’t. When you allow the government to introduce new taxes, they never shrink, only expand.</description>
