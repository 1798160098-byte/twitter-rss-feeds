      <description>In 1707, two thousand sailors DROWNED. Not because of a storm. Because nobody could tell where they were at sea 🇬🇧 This was the longitude problem. The deadliest puzzle in science. Parliament offered £20,000 to anyone who could solve it. Nearly four million today. Every great scientist in Europe tried. Newton. Halley. The finest minds alive. All of them failed. The man who solved it was a carpenter from Yorkshire. His name was John Harrison. No formal education. No university. No wealthy patron. He taught himself clockmaking. Built timepieces out of wood. His idea was “simple”. If you know the exact time at home and the exact time at sea, you can calculate exactly where you are. The problem? No clock could keep accurate time on a moving ship. Heat warps metal. Cold contracts it. The ocean never stops moving. Harrison spent DECADES on it. H1. Twenty years of work. Not good enough. H2. Better. Still not enough. H3. Seventeen years. Over 700 parts. Still not enough. Then he did something nobody expected. He stopped building clocks. He built a watch. H4. Thirteen centimetres across. The most important watch ever made. They sent it across the Atlantic. Eighty-one days at sea. When they arrived, it had lost five seconds. Five seconds. In eighty-one days. The problem was solved. But here's the uncomfortable part. They didn't give him the prize. The Board of Longitude was run by astronomers. The very men who'd been trying to solve it their own way. The Astronomer Royal was both judge and competitor. They changed the rules. Demanded his designs. Refused to pay. A working-class carpenter had beaten every astronomer in Europe. And the establishment couldn't accept it. Harrison was nearly EIGHTY before he got justice. He went directly to King George III. The king tested the watch himself and told Harrison to petition Parliament with the king's full backing. Parliament paid. Harrison died three years later. After his death, every ship on earth carried a chronometer based on his design. Every GPS satellite. Every ship's navigation. Every flight path. All of it traces back to a carpenter from Yorkshire who taught himself to build a watch. His watches are still at the Royal Observatory in Greenwich. Still ticking. Still perfect. The establishment tried to bury him once. We're not letting it happen again 👇proudofus.co.uk/supportBe part of us. Be proud of us. 🇬🇧</description>

      <description>xAI was reorganized a few days ago to improve speed of execution. As a company grows, especially as quickly as xAI, the structure must evolve just like any living organism. This unfortunately required parting ways with some people. We wish them well in future endeavors. We are hiring aggressively. Join xAI if the idea of mass drivers on the Moon appeals to you.</description>
