      <description>Scott Adams breaks down everything that had to happen at the same time for us to finally understand the world: • Trump exposing fake news + winning 2024 •@elonmuskbuying Twitter → turning it into X • DOGE +@MikeBenzCyberrevealing NGO/USAID distortions, censorship industrial complex, and international attacks on US speech •@grokexisting to summarize dense info (esp. Benz’s deep dives) • Discovering color revolutions were turned against America@ScottAdamsSays"We were this close to losing everything, and it almost seems like magic that all the right things happened at the same time. It's very unlikely that all of those things would happen at the same time, but they did. Kind of amazing."</description>

      <description>This is from a 2018 Minnesota criminal prosecution against Somali daycare fraudsters. In surveillance video, Somali parents would take their kids to the daycare, check them in, and then leave with them moments later. The owners of the daycare would then bill the state for a full day of childcare-- and give the parents kickback payments for being in on the fraud. Somali fraudsters have been stealing from taxpayers for years and it's clear that the entire Somali community is in on it.</description>

      <description>The deal was an even playing field, not extremely tilted in the other direction. They broke the deal. Therefore, there is no deal.</description>

      <description>DHS is on the ground in Minneapolis, going DOOR TO DOOR at suspected fraud sites. The American people deserve answers on how their taxpayer money is being used and ARRESTS when abuse is found. Under the leadership of@Sec_Noem, DHS is working to deliver results.</description>

      <description>For years, people attacked Elon Musk over government contracts won by SpaceX....... contracts that saved taxpayers billions and literally rescued U.S. spaceflight Yet those same people never ask: • Where did the $13-15B go on California’s invisible high-speed rail? • Why is there silence on $1B+ daycare fraud by Somalis in Minnesota? • Other 100s of Billions in Fraud Let’s be clear..... If not for Elon, the U.S. would’ve been begging Russia or China to reach the ISS NASA gave Boeing $4.2B SpaceX got $2.6B Here are the result: • SpaceX: Years of successful crew &amp; cargo missions • Boeing: Years late, budget overruns, and stranded astronauts..... SpaceX had to step in Today, SpaceX handles ~90% of the world’s payload to orbit For comparison: • Space Shuttle: 135 missions in 30 years • SpaceX: 165+ Falcon 9 missions in 2025 SpaceX earned those contracts because no one else could do the job....... and did it cheaper, faster, and safer And while some people cry about contracts, Elon is pushing US forward in: • Space • EVs • Manufacturing • AI • Energy Without Elon, U.S. would be behind China in all of it Think about that...</description>

      <description>Even requiring a tiny amount of work for fraudulent payments would have a massive positive effect. That’s how insanely awful the level of fraud actually is!</description>
