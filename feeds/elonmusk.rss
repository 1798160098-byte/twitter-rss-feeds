      <description>If NED is just an NGO funded by our tax dollars and not a covert operations agency, why is the entire $315 million we are forced to pay them marked "sensitive" and we are legally barred from seeing how they spend any of our money ???</description>

      <description>SOMALI FRAUD: We didn’t just import Somali fraudsters and pirates, we imported 3,000 officers who were running the ousted Marxist Somali regime along with their patronage system. Rep Ilhan Omar is the product of one of these genocidal killers.</description>

      <description>now that we're calculating net worth as "control," I'd like to remind you ro khanna is 1 of 535 united states legislators. that gives him around .19% control of a $6.3 trillion budget, and brings his net worth to something like $12 billion. his tax bill: $598,500,000.</description>

      <description>UPDATE: It’s worse than we thought. In October, we flagged $1.3 billion in Medicaid funds that 6 states may have unlawfully spent on health care for illegal immigrants. Since then, we’ve gathered more data and the total has grown to over $1.8 billion across 8 states. It’s against the law to spend federal Medicaid funds on non-emergency healthcare for illegals. If states use their own money to do it, there needs to be a clear paper trail proving that federal dollars didn’t fund those services. These states failed to provide that for this $1.8 billion. So today, CMS is announcing that we’re withholding nearly $300 million from California — which is by far the worst offender — until they demonstrate to our satisfaction that they’re spending that money properly. Medicaid dollars belong to Americans, not illegal immigrants, and we won’t stop until we’ve held rogue states accountable and recovered their misspent funds. More announcements to come.</description>

      <description>NEWS: SpaceX's Starlink is upgrading its cheapest, $50-per-month plan by doubling the amount of monthly data from 50GB to 100GB for no additional cost. The Roam 100GB plan can also continue offering satellite internet access, even after the data cap is exceeded. The connection will just be downgraded to speeds under 1Mbps, or what SpaceX calls “unlimited low-speed data.” In contrast, the original Roam 50GB plan required users to pay for additional data at rate of $1 per GB, otherwise SpaceX would cut off the access for the rest of the month.</description>

      <description>Note: With NSFW enabled, Grok is supposed allow upper body nudity of imaginary adult humans (not real ones) consistent with what can be seen in R-rated movies on Apple TV. That is the de facto standard in America. This will vary in other regions according to the laws on a country by country basis.</description>

      <description>America is 4% of world population, but illegals can scam money from the government that is higher than 95% of Earth and more than most Americans make! America would be swamped, go bankrupt and then cease to exist at all if illegal immigration enforcement were to be defunded.</description>
