      <description>The US continues to fall behind China. We have to go all in on solar + batteries with nuclear for some special cases. Energy is a measure of the work being done.</description>

      <description>Elon Musk: “I do see a path to 100 gigawatts a year of AI powered space solar satellites. If you do a million tons of payload to orbit per year with 100 kilowatts per ton, that's 100 gigawatts of solar powered AI satellites per year. There's a path to get to a terawatt per year, then you want to make those AI satellites on the moon and use a mass driver.”</description>

      <description>"Elon Musk still works incredibly hard. I visited him recently, I left around midnight and he was still working. I think he must have gone till 2am. So I don't know anybody who works as hard as him. He's really in the technical details of it." 一 David Sacks</description>

      <description>Melania doc tracking ~$8M opening - best for a documentary in 10 years. Congrats,@FLOTUS! You could tell Pres Trump is proud of her, joking as if threatened by her success at an event. She’s a classy lady; love her advocacy for the hostages and AI education, and quiet strength.</description>

      <description>"For a while there, I was just sleeping under my desk, which is out in the open in the factory, for an important reason. And it was damn uncomfortable sleeping on that floor always when I woke up, I’d smell like metal dust I stopped using the couch in the little conference room and just slept on the floor under my desk so that during shift change, the entire team could see me And that’s important because if they think that their leader is off somewhere having a good time, drinking Mai Tais on a tropical island which I definitely could have been doing and would much have preferred to do I’m not actually a masochist, I think the thing is that since the team could see me sleeping on the floor during shift change, they knew I was there. And that made a huge difference" - ELON MUSK</description>
