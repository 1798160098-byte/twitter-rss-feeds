      <description>🚨 URGENT CALL TO ACTION: FLOOD Senator Grassley's Office!🚨 Senator Chuck Grassley (@ChuckGrassley) is blocking the SAVE Act—refusing to support requiring proof of citizenship for federal voter registration, even though the Constitution empowers Congress to regulate elections! He wrote: “I do not believe that Iowa and other states need politicians in Washington, D.C. dictating and controlling how states run their elections.” This ignores what Republican voters DEMAND: secure elections NOW! We can't let RINOs stand in the way of election integrity under President Trump. **Tell@ChuckGrassleyto SUPPORT the SAVE Act IMMEDIATELY!** - **Washington D.C. Office Phone:** (202) 224-3744 - **Fax:** (202) 224-6020 - **Online Contact Form:**grassley.senate.gov/contact/…(Fill it out and demand he back the SAVE Act!) - **Official Website:**grassley.senate.govCall, email, fax—make your voice heard LOUD and CLEAR! Let him know Iowa voters (and patriots nationwide) won't stand for this betrayal. Hold him accountable! Tag him everywhere:@ChuckGrassley@GrassleyPress#SAVEAct#ElectionIntegrity#CallGrassley#MAGA#AmericaFirst🇺🇸</description>

      <description>ELON: TRUTH AND CURIOSITY KEEP AI SANE “Truth will prevent AI from going insane. Curiosity will foster any form of sentience. We’re more interesting than a bunch of rocks. If it’s curious, it will foster humanity. If it has a sense of beauty, it will be a great future. That applies to AI just as it applies to biological life.” Source:@ianmiles</description>

      <description>Minnesotas Department of Human Services has given over $724,000,000 to an NGO(s) who’s name has been protected as “Masked to protect Not Public Data” This is suspicious because other NGOs have their name but this certain NGO has been protected. Expose all the fraud</description>

I don't just have courtside seats: I'm on the court. And it blows my mind, and it still blows my mind, sometimes multiple times a week. I'm like, wow and then two days later, more wow! I think we'll hit AGI next year in 2026.” Source:@elonmuskin Moonshot – Discussion with@PeterDiamandisand@DavidBlundin, January 2026</description>

      <description>ELON: THE ECONOMY IS NOT A MAGIC CORNUCOPIA “Some people have this absurd view that the economy is like some magic horn of plenty. Like it just makes stuff. Goods and services just come from this magic corner of plenty. And if somebody has more stuff than somebody else, it’s because they took more from this magic corner of plenty.” Source:@joerogan</description>

      <description>ELON MUSK: WE ARE REALLY TRYING TO BRING THE WORLD TOGETHER INTO A COLLECTIVE CONSCIOUSNESS 𝕏 is kind of a global town square where people can say what they want to say with words, pictures, video Where there's a secure messaging system we've recently added the ability to do audio and video calls So really trying to bring the world together into a collective consciousness And that's different from just saying, 'What is the most dopamine-generating video stream that one could make?' Which I think can be a little bit of brain rot If you're just watching videos that cause dopamine hits one after another but lack substance, then I think that's not a great way to spend time</description>
