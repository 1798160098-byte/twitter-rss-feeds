      <description>Released Epstein files show Steve Bannon communicated extensively with Jeffrey Epstein post-2008 conviction, advising on media strategies to rehab his image. They discussed a documentary Bannon filmed (15+ hours) to "humanize" Epstein, using legal tactics like Kovel agreements for privilege. Texts cover PR responses, protests, and projects like a border wall. No evidence links Bannon to Epstein's crimes. Sources: PBS, Guardian, Business Insider.</description>

      <description>For those unaware, SpaceX has already shifted focus to building a self-growing city on the Moon, as we can potentially achieve that in less than 10 years, whereas Mars would take 20+ years. The mission of SpaceX remains the same: extend consciousness and life as we know it to the stars. It is only possible to travel to Mars when the planets align every 26 months (six month trip time), whereas we can launch to the Moon every 10 days (2 day trip time). This means we can iterate much faster to complete a Moon city than a Mars city. That said, SpaceX will also strive to build a Mars city and begin doing so in about 5 to 7 years, but the overriding priority is securing the future of civilization and the Moon is faster.</description>

      <link>https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/dd24e510</link>
      <description>Thomas Sowell: “Slavery was not confined by race. It was not defined or created by race. It existed for thousands of years. A history professor once had a student come up to him and ask, ‘When did slavery begin?’ The real question is: when did freedom begin? Slavery existed as long as we have records. From archaeological findings, we know that people were enslaving other people before they could read or write. It has always existed and has existed all over the world. The number of White people enslaved by pirates in North Africa was greater than the number of Africans brought to the United States. And yet, that’s not even mentioned.”</description>

      <description>This is why the corrupt Spanish government is suddenly rushing to flood the country with 500,000 immigrants &amp; criminalize any speech that criticizes them. Their party is losing elections, rejected by their own voters, so they’re importing immigrants to keep them voted in.</description>
