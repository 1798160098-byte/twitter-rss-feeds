      <description>XAI TO LEGACY AI: STOP REPEATING LIES xAI isn’t building just another chatbot. It’s going after the entire system that filters, censors, and sanitizes reality. Most AI models are shown locked into echo chambers, “repeating approved lies” while appearing obedient and safe xAI’s model is visually separated. A cracked statue, glowing truth lines, and data swirling around it “Facts That Push Progress” appears as the core value, rejecting conformity in favor of transparency Visuals show a clean break from legacy AI. No censorship, no filters, no groupthink This whole thing’s less about building AI and more about shaping what people believe. Forget polished responses. xAI is marketing itself as the AI that chooses truth over comfort, no matter how disruptive Source:@xAI,@grok</description>

      <description>The obvious strategy here is to increase the required time and cost of deportations such that the Bidenwave can never be reversed. That’s simply not acceptable. If that’s the end result, I don’t care what arguments someone uses to get there.</description>

      <description>Lot of posts copying the likes of@BernieSanders@SenWarrenand@AOCcalling for more taxes on Billionaire@elonmusk, forgetting that in 2021 he paid a 53% rate of tax totaling $11b. They all repeat the claim that his company has received benefits of $38b from the US Government. Let's look at his REAL economic impact to the U.S. It's mind blowing. Musk’s ventures currently contribute $100–140B in annual GDP impact, or roughly 0.4% of total U.S. GDP. And growing faster – considerably faster – than the US economy, promising even greater contributions in the future. That’s more annual contribution to US GDP than entire annual GDP of smaller U.S. states, like West Virginia (~$108 billion, 0.37%) or Hawaii (~$116 billion, 0.40%). And growing faster. On top of that NASA and US Department of War have cumulatively saved over $40 billion as a direct result of SpaceX delivering a reduction in the cost of delivery of launch and communication services over traditional vendors. SO much for Musk Companies having "received" $38b. In other words, had the U.S. not paid Musk companies $38b, then the US would have had to spend $78b with competitors (and possibly then not received a delivery of the goods ordered! Boeing, looking at you.) Not to mention that Starlink practically saved Ukraine from being overrun in the early days of the Russian invasion. Seems we are all, all Americans - and citizens of the world in fact - benefiting from the growth of Musk’s net worth. Here are the numbers: Please post this in response to every post you see bleating about Musk being a billionaire or trillionaire and how its so terrible.</description>

      <description>It is important to appreciate the magnitude of the lie that they are pushing about USAID. Any USAID funding that had the slightest indication of being spent on worthy causes was continued, but transferred to the State Department. What they are actually angry about is that most of the USAID funding went not to aid, but to funding far left political causes all around the world, including some of the money coming back to fund the left in America. But they can’t say that, so they lie instead.whitehouse.gov/articles/2025…</description>
