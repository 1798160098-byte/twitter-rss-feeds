      <description>For those fools/liars who say it is racist to require ID to vote (it obviously is not), why do majority Black countries require ID to vote?</description>

      <description>Elon Musk: Nothing any of my companies have done has been to stifle competition In fact, we’ve done the opposite So at Tesla, we have open-sourced our patents. Anyone can use our patents for free How many companies do you know who’ve done that? Can you name one? I can’t At SpaceX, we don’t use patents. Once in a while, we’ll file a patent just so some patent troll doesn’t cause trouble, but we’re not stopping anyone We’ve done nothing anti-competitive We’ve done nothing to stop our competitors. I just want to clarify for the audience, because some companies have done anti-competitive things. I think the unusual thing about SpaceX and Tesla is that we’ve done things that have helped our competition So at Tesla, we have made our Supercharger system open access. We’ve made our charger technology available for free to other manufacturers</description>

      <description>Starship will be able to do both the Moon and Mars. The destination, as I wrote in Rocket Dreams, doesn't matter as much as the means of ascent. The good news is: we're GOING.</description>

      <description>I don’t need to conduct a research study to identify that there is an undeniable pattern of violence here. Another Trans person just shot 35 people, killing 10 in Canada. Giving mentally ill people cross sex hormones to affirm a delusion is DANGEROUS. Knowing this is COMMON SENSE.</description>

      <description>The trans kid who murdered over ten people, and injured more, also killed his mother and younger brother. Turns out, supporting your children in their sexual delusions will probably get you killed too.</description>

      <description>Tesla Cybertruck is one of the best pickup trucks you can buy right now Cybertruck earned a Top Safety Pick+ with a perfect "Good" rating in all major crash tests, making it the only pickup truck to achieve the highest IIHS safety tier in 2025 It also holds a five-star overall rating from NHTSA That’s top-level safety But it does much more: •⁠ ⁠123 kWh battery - equal to about 9 Tesla Powerwalls •⁠ ⁠Can power your house for 3–4 days during a blackout •⁠ ⁠Heavy waterproof and built for extreme conditions •⁠ ⁠Can carry heavy loads and still go faster than most pickup trucks •⁠ ⁠Ultra-Hard 30X Cold-Rolled stainless steel exoskeleton - 7x stronger than typical exterior steel • Cyberbeast: 0-60 mph in 2.6 seconds - faster than most sports cars Cyber truck is a safety + powerhouse on wheels….</description>

      <description>xAI was reorganized a few days ago to improve speed of execution. As a company grows, especially as quickly as xAI, the structure must evolve just like any living organism. This unfortunately required parting ways with some people. We wish them well in future endeavors. We are hiring aggressively. Join xAI if the idea of mass drivers on the Moon appeals to you.</description>
