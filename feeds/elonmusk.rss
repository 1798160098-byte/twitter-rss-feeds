      <description>One of the greatest humanitarian achievements of the Trump Admin is shutting down the child trafficking that raged under Biden. (Dems lost nearly 500K minors). Core to ending this cartel business is making clear that smuggled or kidnapped children will be humanely returned home.</description>

      <description>🇺🇸 WHEN JUDGES FORGET THEY'RE REFEREES, NOT PLAYERS The Supreme Court confirmation process has become political theater because we've turned judges into politicians in robes. When every major decision splits 5-4 along predictable ideological lines, we're not seeing legal interpretation; we're seeing policy preferences dressed up as jurisprudence. This is a system problem. The real damage isn't any single ruling but the erosion of public trust. When citizens can predict how judges will rule based on who appointed them, the law becomes just politics by other means. Judges are supposed to be referees calling balls and strikes, not players trying to win the game themselves. Here's what's been lost: the idea that legal questions have legal answers, not just political ones. When judges start from their desired outcome and work backward to find justification, they're not interpreting law; they're making it.</description>

      <description>WOW 🚨 Entire office buildings are being discovered in Portland Maine, each on packed with home health care companies that are “rarely staffed” Multiple buildings with 20-22+ home health care companies found IN ONE BUILDING “It's the same thing that we're finding in Minnesota, just to be completely blunt, the same tactics being used to defraud Medicaid. In this case, Zombie offices, I call them, where large clusters of home health care businesses and providers in one location. We saw them in Minnesota and we're seeing them here and the business owners and building owners that we speak to here say, enough. We're here in Portland, Maine. We found of the businesses that are registered in here of the 20-something businesses, 10 of them are home health care businesses As you can see, Prestige Home Care, Bright Star Home Care, Atlanta Community Support, Five Stars Home Health Care, Prime Home Care, LLC. It's a trend we saw in Minnesota, one that the Minnesota House Oversight Committee on Fraud — Large clusters of healthcare providers in one location. This building right behind me has 22 different home and community-based healthcare companies registered in the building Inside this Portland office building — I think I got 10 healthcare companies — Healthcare, healthcare, healthcare, home healthcare.“</description>

      <description>Christmas Eve 2008. Tesla closed a funding round in the final hour, days from bankruptcy. Elon Musk put in all his money &amp; assets, borrowed from friends just to pay rent. If it missed, payroll would have bounced two days after Christmas.</description>
