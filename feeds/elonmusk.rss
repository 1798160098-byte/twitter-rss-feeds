      <description>Even assuming there was no fraud, none of this makes sense. How is it that we have been funding billions of dollars of daycare for Somali immigrants in Minnesota 81% of which (according to Gemini) are on welfare? In other words, if mom and dad don’t work, why the need for child care? Perhaps you could say the welfare statistics include some subsidies for working parents, but still in this case, the child care does not appear to be needed as the daycare centers are empty. Furthermore, why is Federal funded childcare provided to recent immigrants on welfare versus long-standing American working families who are not on welfare? How does this make sense?</description>

      <description>I like how he just tries to slide in the phrase “White men commit the most crime” like it’s a given Here’s the homicide data for the state of Minnesota, and the total crime data for Hennepin county Not only do white people not commit the most crime, they don’t even commit most of the crimeS You have 5x as many white people in Minnesota as black people. Somehow the 169K black people committed almost twice the total number of crimes that 857K white people did over the same time span I get that it’s tacky to bring up crime stats but this is utter horseshit, and an outright, bald-faced lie. I’m not going to just sit here and accept him saying this and not push back</description>

      <description>I went to 4 more Somali childcare locations today. Two told me they weren’t childcares despite receiving hundreds of thousands of tax payer dollars. One which claimed they weren’t a childcare received over $800,000 since 2023. It’s all on camera. It will be uncovered.</description>

      <description>It’s this simple, folks: stop all illegal immigration. Deport all illegal aliens here now. Enact Voter ID laws. That will solve every problem America has. We will reduce taxes, stop crime, fraud, Democrat DEI scams, inflation, homelessness, and the housing crisis.</description>
