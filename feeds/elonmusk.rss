      <description>Rabbi explains why White men are always potrayed as the bad guys in movies: ”Because they are the only group that has no defence league, anyone else would be on us if we made them the bad guys" This unfair anti-White discrimination must end. Anti-White racism is also racism.</description>

      <description>Elon Musk: The real breakthrough SpaceX is chasing isn’t hype — it’s full reusability. No one in history has ever built a fully reusable rocket, and that’s why access to space is still insanely expensive — We’ve already landed Falcon 9 boosters over 500 times, but we still throw away the upper stage — and that alone costs as much as a small jet. Starship changes everything. When every part of a rocket comes back, space stops being exclusive and starts becoming scalable. Starship is the largest flying machine ever made — built for Mars, the Moon, and massive satellite deployment. But the real revolution isn’t where it goes… it’s that it comes back. Full reusability is the single biggest lever for lowering the cost of space in human history. Automation and AI matter — but without full reusability, space will always be expensive. Starship is designed to change the economics entirely. Prove full reusability, and the cost of reaching orbit drops by a factor of 100. That’s how Mars stops being a dream and starts being a plan.</description>

      <description>Maye Musk recalls Elon telling her he wanted to create a network of satellites to save lives: "Elon surprises us every time when he says he's going to do something. When he said to me, 'I'm going to put satellites in the air so that people who are in the forest, or on hills, or in the middle of the ocean can be saved, it will save lives,' and now, it's saving lives around the world."</description>

      <description>Once you realize how many Judges are connected to or have a family member connected to a NGO, Nonprofit, Firm etc everything makes sense. Our judiciary has been fully corrupted. Bought. It’s one of the most important issues of our time. To save America this must be addressed.</description>
