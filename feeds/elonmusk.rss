      <description>No civilization is perfectly level. Therefore, either a civilization is expanding or contracting. Collapsing birth rates mean that most cultures are tending towards extinction! Expanding is the only option for those who want LIfE, for those who CARE about the FUTURE.</description>

      <description>This is because California’s state and local politicians have completely broken LA and the state in general. It is increasingly untenable to do business: - Too many permits - Too many laws - Too much overreach - Too many delays - Too many taxes It’s killed Hollywood and it’s coming for Silicon Valley next. The difference is that Silicon Valley can move. Hollywood just sat by while the government and party they blindly supported gutted their industry. We won’t.</description>

      <description>What’s amazing about this is the fact that the survivor rate of First Class men was lower than Third Class women. The richest men on the ship, and in the world, stood and waited for their deaths so that the women could take a life boat</description>

      <description>My friend’s cousin recently went out in Milan and ended up at an afterparty. What began as a normal night quickly turned into a nightmare. A group of Somalis held him against his will, took all of his belongings, and threatened him. They forced him to log into his accounts and transfer all of his money and cryptocurrency. He was threatened with knives and guns and genuinely believed he was going to die. In the end, he fought back and managed to escape, knowing they might kill him, but feeling it was his only chance. I have never heard of something remotely like this happening to someone in my social sphere before third-world mass immigration to Europe.</description>
