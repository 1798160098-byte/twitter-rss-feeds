      <description>“Elon always takes the high road. He will always do the hard things.”@nikitabierbreaks down what makes@elonmuskthe greatest operator alive: “At an Elon company—it’s a very flat organization.” “A large number of people direct report to Elon. Everyone has an incredible amount of agency.” “We come up with an idea, build it in a week, and it’s out. At Facebook, things would take months for approvals.” “I’ve never seen an executive with his amount of responsibility who is that deep in the weeds.” “He does weekly reviews with every engineer at the company. You present 1–2 slides: ‘What did you get done this week?’” “The amount of context switching he has to do between SpaceX, Tesla, xAI, X, Boring Company, and Neuralink— it’s incredible.” “When you’re a consumer product builder, you’re always looking for growth hacks. Quick wins. I’ll present those options— he’ll be like, ‘No. We’re going to do the hard thing.’” “A lot of these things seem impossible, but when he gives engineers the agency to do it, and says, ‘Let’s make it two weeks. Rebuild the algorithm in two weeks,’ amazing things happen. Miracles happen.” Via@lightspeedvp@mignano</description>

      <description>I feel I need to comment on this because I have been through this professionally and I have to 100% agree with Elon here. Simply because I have seen too often what 'having a safety team' means. These get established because safety did not work. Instead of changing the culture - so safety is default thinking - you try to establish a department. Which subsequently is hated by everyone because they infringe on product timelines and do not eat their own dogfood. So their safety is usually percentage statistical Excel table magic. Not real safety. I could talk about several instances of this, but cannot due to NDA. But believe me: If someone sells you their safety ,because they have an amazing 'safety team, costing billions in CapEx and OpEx: Walk away. Safety is not their culture, it is a spreadsheet item.</description>

      <description>🚨EPSTEIN FILES: THE RED FLAGS EXPOSED AROUND LINKEDIN BILLIONAIRE REID HOFFMAN His name appears 2,600 times in the files. Let's break down why. The Visits: Reid Hoffman stayed at Epstein's private island. He stayed at the Manhattan townhouse. He stayed at Zorro Ranch in New Mexico. A 2014 scheduling email confirms: "Jeffrey will have Joi Ito and Reid Hoffman will go to the ranch for the weekend." That's six years after the conviction. The Dinner: In 2011, Hoffman hosted a Silicon Valley dinner with Epstein as the guest of honor, introducing a registered sex offender to tech's elite inner circle. The Funding: He later admitted to funding Epstein's research projects and paying his legal fees. The Ice Cream Email: One bizarre email shows Epstein asking Hoffman to get "ice cream" with young women. The same coded food language that appears throughout these files. The Media Protection: The New York Times ran a big Epstein-Silicon Valley story and buried Hoffman in one sentence. He's one of the Democratic Party's largest donors. Island trips. Ranch stays. Townhouse visits. Dinner parties. Legal funding. Strange emails. 2,600 file mentions. They're red flags everywhere you look. When the media shields its own donors but torches others, who's really controlling the narrative? Source: Lincoln Media YT / NYT</description>

      <description>Elon Musk inspires us. He wants us to wake up in the morning feeling that the future is going to be great, and that’s what being a spacefaring civilization is all about. It’s about inspiring people to think about the stars. ✨</description>

      <description>It would seem that 14 year old girls are not learning in 8th sex-ed class that if they transition to a boy that they will experience vaginal dryness and pelvic floor collapse and never give birth vaginally as adults. I will stop posting these when this madness ends.</description>

      <description>For a country to survive, there has to be a common culture. Nobody dies to defend a “multicultural economic zone”! American culture, with its English-Scotts-Irish origin, is great and worth fighting for. Some may not realize it, but that’s why people come here. 🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸</description>

      <description>If C.S. Lewis had been asked by radical Senate Democrats to defend "British Culture" and why it matters, this is what he would have said: "A man’s reasons for not wanting his country to be ruled by foreigners are very like his reasons for not wanting his house to be burned down; because he could not even begin to enumerate all the things he would miss."</description>

      <description>I used to be opposed to death penalty, because I figured we’re wealthy, we can afford incarceration, and what if we get the wrong guy? Two things changed my mind: 1. Actually looking at actual death penalty cases 2. Realizing how many progressives want to set murderers free</description>
