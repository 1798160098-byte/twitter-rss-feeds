      <description>Elon Musk: “I would encourage everyone to be optimistic and excited about the future. And generally, I think for quality of life, it is actually better to err on the side of being an optimist and wrong rather than a pessimist and right.” Legendary quote</description>

      <description>SpaceX just filed with the FCC to launch up to 1M satellites designed to function as solar-powered orbital data centers creating massive AI compute capacity in space. Elon wants to use Starship’s low launch costs and laser-linked satellites to scale AI compute without stressing Earth’s power grid.</description>

      <description>History will remember that it was Elon who fought the hardest to get the Epstein files released. It came at great risk to his life and his fortune. He was taking on some of the most powerful people on the planet to get those files released.</description>

      <description>We didn't need it, but here's more confirmation. Tesla just eliminated everything in this graphic from the 4680 battery production process. Many actual battery companies haven't yet been able to do this. Tesla's cost per kWh for the 4680 was already more cost effective than getting comparable cells from suppliers. This breakthrough of solving DBE for the cathode will drive costs down further. This is a big deal$TSLA</description>

      <description>Epstein hounded me relentlessly to go to his pedo island and I always declined. Not you though. You actually went. What “gifts” did you bring to Epstein when you went to pedo island?</description>

      <link>https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/c5d099dd</link>
      <description>Nobody has fought harder for full release of the Epstein files and prosecutions of those who abused children more than I did, knowing full well that the legacy media, far-left propagandists and those who are actually guilty would: 1. Admit nothing 2. Deny everything 3. Make counter-accusations against me I knew that I would be smeared relentlessly, despite never having attended his parties or been on his “Lolita Express” plane or set foot on his creepy island or done anything wrong at all. Nonetheless, the extreme pain of being accused of being the opposite of who I am was worth it. The strong must protect those cannot protect themselves, especially vulnerable children. I will gladly accept any amount of future pain to do more to protect kids and give them a chance to grow up and have happy lives.</description>
