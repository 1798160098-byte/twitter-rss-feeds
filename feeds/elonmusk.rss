An Arab state now views a European state as a dangerous Islamist radicalization hotspot</description>

      <description>🚨 SEEN IN MINNEAPOLIS — Left-wing agitators threaten the lives of our immigration officials: “We’re going to fucking find you, and we’re going to fucking kill you! You’re going to fucking die, bitch!” This is directly inspired by Democrat politicians.</description>

      <description>At 2:19 PST, US Border Patrol agents were conducting a targeted vehicle stop in Portland, Oregon. The passenger of the vehicle and target is a Venezuelan illegal alien affiliated with the transnational Tren de Aragua prostitution ring and involved in a recent shooting in Portland. The vehicle driver is believed to be a member of the vicious Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua. When agents identified themselves to the vehicle occupants, the driver weaponized his vehicle and attempted to run over the law enforcement agents. Fearing for his life and safety, an agent fired a defensive shot. The driver drove off with the passenger, fleeing the scene. This situation is evolving and more information is forthcoming.</description>

      <description>A Wisconsin man has admitted to killing his parents to steal their money to fund a plot to assassinate President Trump. Nikita Casal pleaded guilty to intentional homicide in Waukesha County on Jan. 8. Charges of two counts of hiding a corpse, two for theft of movable property, two for identity theft, one for taking a vehicle without consent and one for intimidating a witness with threat of force — were dismissed as part of the plea deal. For years, leftists and some Democrats have been encouraging people to kill Trump to “protect democracy” and “stop hate.” It has led to deadly shootings of his supporters.ngocomment.com</description>

      <description>My dad is the only person who would service his plane. In order to move from Canada to South Africa, he had to remove the wings from the plane. That is why we were in a cargo ship. When we reached Cape Town, he attached the wings, then flew to Pretoria.</description>
