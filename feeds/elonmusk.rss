      <description>10 hours into Tesla FSD v14.2.2 and here are my thoughts: Zero lane change hesitation at all. Extremely refined, excellent lane choices and some parking improvements are a few things to note. Really stoked about the lane changes on this build. There is ZERO lane indecisiveness, no hesitation, no stuttering. Nothing. I had never really seen much before, but this build you can tell its decision making process is much quicker and it commits. Mad Max mode is definitely mad again and I love it. Seems even quicker than v14.2.1.25 which was an improvement, but the lane changes + choices are better now. Hurry mode seems quicker on the highways and larger roads than before and very close to Mad Max, it was perfect before on v14.2.1.25. The new addition on the release notes for arrival pin being adjusted based on arrival option works. It changes the route based on if you’re going curbside, or to the lot or street parking. It behaved that way before usually but now it’s visualized. Parking is improved and impressive this build. Every single spot I parked in, it performed excellent. Centered in the lines, quick one and done parking jobs and they were great, improvement over early v14.2 builds. In parking garages, it now pulls up exactly at the ticket dispenser where in earlier v14.2 builds it would stop 9 inches short like I mentioned in previous v14.2+ build reviews. That’s fixed and worked great- couldn’t have asked for it to be any better. Perfect distance and approach- will do a lot more of this testing tomorrow. Canyon roads were insanely impressive. Did the snake 3 times which is a super narrow and twisty road and each time it performed great. Speeds were good, took the proper lines and even accelerated out of corners very well. These were all in the dark too very late at night- will post some more videos of it. Stop and go traffic performance in rush hour was awesome as before, with some added notes for how well it waited to enter an intersection if there was stopped traffic on the other side. It waited 3/3 lights I encountered where if it went and the light changed, it would be sticking into traffic so it didn’t go. Exactly like a human wouldn’t but the car judged it better than I did. One time it creeped a bit slow, but other than that fine since. Saw one instance of red hands but before I could react, it had already recovered itself. Still so impressed with how well it handles lane splitting motorcycles. It sees them approaching before I even do, and moves over just enough to be courteous to the rider as well as the car or shoulder next to me. Nice touch, and glad to see it perform well. One thing I noticed is how smooth its steering inputs always are. It just takes corners with such precision and smoothness that no human could ever come close to it. Especially noticeable on twisty roads- it drives better than almost every human on them. And I encountered a power outage tonight and the car still drove perfectly even with pitch black around. Overall, loving what I’m seeing with this build. Will report back in the day time with more but I am going to head home to get some sleep. Another huge thank you to all the magicians@Tesla_AIfor working so hard during the holiday season to get these updates out.</description>

      <description>What is@grok? It is deep empathy! From Heinlein’s Stranger in a Strange Land: Grok means "identically equal". The human cliché "This hurts me worse than it does you" has a distinctly Martian flavor. The Martian seems to know instinctively what we learned painfully from modern physics, that observer acts with observed through the process of observation. Grokmeans to understand so thoroughly that the observer becomes a part of the observed — to merge, blend, intermarry, lose identity in group experience. It means almost everything that we mean by religion, philosophy, and science and it means as little to us as color does to a blind man.</description>

      <description>한국 테슬라 오너들이 단 1개월 만에 FSD(감독형)으로 누적 주행거리 100만 km를 돌파했습니다. 이는 대한민국을 약 480바퀴 돌고도 남는 거리입니다! *섬을 제외한 공식 해안선 길이와 북쪽 국경 기준, 1바퀴당 약 2,413 km Korea Tesla owners have surpassed 1 million km of cumulative driving distance with FSD (Supervised) in just one month. This distance is enough to circle the entire country of South Korea approximately 480 times—with some to spare! *Based on the official coastline length (excluding islands) and the northern border, one full lap is approximately 2,413 km.</description>

      <description>ELON: “VIRTUE SIGNALING KILLS” Elon gets serious when asked why he called Sen. Mark Kelly a "Traitor" for pushing to send more U.S. aid and weapons to Ukraine. He’s calling out what he sees as moral theater around the war, arguing that thousands keep dying in trenches with “no movement in the lines” and no realistic path to stopping it. It’s an uncomfortable take, but it cuts through slogans and forces the question many avoid: if there’s no plan to end it, what exactly are all these lives being lost for? “We should have empathy for the thousands of people dying everyday in the trenches, for no movement in the lines, for the past two years thousands of people have died every week for nothing. I take great offense at those who put the appearance of goodness over the reality of it. Those who virtue signal and say we can't give into Russia, but have no solution to stopping thousands of kids dying every day. I have contempt for such people and I want to make that clear, because they're virtue signaling and their lack of a solution means that kids don't have a father… It means parents lost a son. For what? Nothing." Source:@elonmusk, Fox News</description>
