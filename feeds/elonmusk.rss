      <description>When a nation forgets its history, it risks repeating its darkest mistakes. That is why Congressman Wesley Hunt has introduced legislation to establish a 28th Amendment, requiring every member of Congress to pass a basic civics exam before taking the oath of office. Those entrusted with representing the American people should first demonstrate a clear understanding of the Constitution, our history, and the principles that built this nation. Knowledge of our founding ideals is not optional. It is essential. Because protecting America’s future begins with honoring its past, and safeguarding the foundations of this Republic starts with leaders who truly understand it.</description>

      <description>SpaceX just officially shifted its #1 priority to building a self-growing city on the Moon. Not a base. Not an outpost. A city. Here's why it makes sense: you can launch to the Moon every 10 days vs. every 26 months for Mars. Two-day trip vs. six months. That means hundreds of iteration cycles before you could even attempt the same thing on Mars. And today Elon Musk followed up saying SpaceX will build a system that lets anyone travel to the Moon. The engineering logic here is sound. Build fast, learn fast, then go further.</description>

      <description>21 people are controlling computers with their thoughts. Not in a research demo. In their daily lives. Neuralink's Telepathy trial has nearly doubled since September. The implant reads your motor cortex and translates neural signals into digital commands. No voice. No eye tracking. No hands. One participant hit able-bodied cursor speeds in his first week. Others are typing at 40 words per minute using imagined finger movements. A med student uses it 17 hours a day to study. A woman who hadn't controlled a computer in 20 years is making art. A father with ALS rigged a 360 camera to his wheelchair and controls it telepathically so he can watch his kids. Next up: 3x the electrodes, a new trial targeting real-time speech at 140 WPM, and zero serious device-related adverse events across every participant so far. Brain-computer interfaces are no longer theoretical.</description>
