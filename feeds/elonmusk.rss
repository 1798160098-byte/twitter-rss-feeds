      <description>🇺🇸 Epstein’s associate Al Seckel hacking Wikipedia to replace his mug shot, scrub the "sex offender" label, and rebrand him as "businessman, philanthropist." They even recorded the IPs of anyone who tried to edit it back and blocked them out. And people still trust Wikipedia as a source. File number: EFTA02416819</description>

      <description>This is why European nations just hanged these criminals: getting rid of them works Over the course of roughly the 15th to mid-18th centuries, about 1% of each generation in Europe was executed, with states getting serious about solving violent crime and using the gallows to solve it Over 200 crimes, most of them theft-related, were capital crimes. Year after year, the criminal class faced the gallows, and year after year those sentences were carried out It worked. After a few centuries of work, the crime genes had essentially been plucked out of the gene pool, and there just wasn't that much serious crime anymore; by the end of the 18th century, the homicide rate had fallen from over 40 per 100,000--higher than even most of America's notoriously violent cities--to less than 1 per 100k population, far safer than most modern nations. Doing something similar, even if just life imprisonment, would work similarly well now. Just taking the lawbreakers off the streets for good and preventing them from propagating their genes, however that's done, fixes the crime problem We ought learn from our ancestors, and do as they would do</description>

      <description>The worst Epstein document I've seen. A little girl said Jesus makes her feel safe so they dressed up as Jesus as they raped &amp; murdered her. The level of evil we're dealing with here is incomprehensible. Every single name must be revealed and justice must be served.</description>

      <description>The Irish will become a minority in Ireland because Irish men are afraid of being called racist and upsetting people from the 3rd world. What a pathetic way for an ancient civilization like Ireland to disappear.</description>

      <description>We are literally paying foreigners to rape British women. Abolish asylum. Blanket reject all applications. Deport every single last one of them. I don't care about the Refugee Convention. What are they going to do, send an UN army to rape more women?</description>

      <description>Elon Musk: Nothing any of my companies have done has been to stifle competition In fact, we’ve done the opposite So at Tesla, we have open-sourced our patents. Anyone can use our patents for free How many companies do you know who’ve done that? Can you name one? I can’t At SpaceX, we don’t use patents. Once in a while, we’ll file a patent just so some patent troll doesn’t cause trouble, but we’re not stopping anyone We’ve done nothing anti-competitive We’ve done nothing to stop our competitors. I just want to clarify for the audience, because some companies have done anti-competitive things. I think the unusual thing about SpaceX and Tesla is that we’ve done things that have helped our competition So at Tesla, we have made our Supercharger system open access. We’ve made our charger technology available for free to other manufacturers</description>

      <description>I don’t need to conduct a research study to identify that there is an undeniable pattern of violence here. Another Trans person just shot 35 people, killing 10 in Canada. Giving mentally ill people cross sex hormones to affirm a delusion is DANGEROUS. Knowing this is COMMON SENSE.</description>
