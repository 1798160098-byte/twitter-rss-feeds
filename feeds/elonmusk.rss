      <description>You cannot spend decades treating a group as a collective “problem” and then act shocked when its members begin to think in collective terms. The Left has consistently attacked the European roots of America, broadly labeling it “White culture,” while critiquing American institutions, history, and traditions as “White supremacy” and “privilege.” Yet they simultaneously celebrate and fund the group interests of their preferred racial and ethnic blocs. Congress openly organizes broad caucuses for Black, Hispanic, and Asian interests, but any advocacy for the group that laid America’s foundation is treated as uniquely illegitimate. This game is rigged. They strategically demand the break down of White identity into small sub-groups while they organize theirs into political monoliths. It’s heads they win, tails you lose.</description>

      <description>BREAKING: The French police arrest 9 far-left extremists suspected of killing the 23-year-old mathematics student Quentin Deranque in Lyon. Several of the suspects are linked to an Antifa group founded by the far-left Member of the French Parliament Raphaël Arnault, who is a member of Jean-Luc Melenchon’s La France Insoumise Party (LFI). One of the nine men arrested is Arnault’s parliamentary assistant Jacques-Eli Favrot, who was photographed at the scene when Quentin was killed. The far-left extremists were at the site to attack members of the nationalist women’s rights organization@Coll_Nemesis. The nationalist women were planning to unfurl a banner in front of a university where Rima Hassan, a far-left Member of the European Parliament from the same LFI party that Arnault and Favrot represent, was giving a speech. The prosecutor is now investigating the 9 men for mansluaghter, aggravated assault, and forming a criminal association. The far-left extremists are said to have repeatedly kicked Quentin in the head when he was already unconscious on the ground, causing fatal injuries to. When he was attacked, Deranque trying protecting the nationalist women protesting in front of the university. Several of the far-left attackers are members of Antifa group 'Jeune Garde,' which was banned by the Ministry of the Interior last year following repeated acts of violence and incitements to violence. A government spokesperson, Maud Bregeon, yesterday criticized the far-left LFI party, stating that the party bears a 'moral responsibility for a climate of increasing violence.' Education Minister Philippe Baptiste simultaneously announced that he wants to ban public gatherings at universities out of fear of new unrest. 'Speech aimed at inciting young people, driving them out onto the streets to provoke violent clashes – that can no longer be allowed in educational institutions today, as the risk of unrest is obvious,' the minister stated. The French Parliament also decided to hold a minute of silence for Quentin Deranque. The decision was made by Speaker Yaël Braun-Pivet without any objections, reports Le Parisien. Strong criticism is also directed at the LFI’s Member of Parliament Raphaël Arnault for his proximity to violent far-left environments. Over the weekend, he stated that he received the news of the death with 'horror and disgust.' Quentin Deranque studied mathematics and had begun further studies in computer science. At the same time, he worked for the railway company SNCF. Friends describe him as diligent, religious, peaceful and as a recent convert to Catholicism. 'Quentin became a Catholic for identitarian reasons. Patriotism and love of God were united in him,' said a friend. On the day of his death, he is said to have been warned against participating in the protest. But according to reports, he firmly replied that he had no intention of leaving the young women to face the danger from far-left extremists all one their own.</description>

      <description>Grok 4.20 beta wrote one of the most beautiful “T cell poems” I’ve ever seen. This is one of my measures of how well a model can generalize a scientific topic into poetic expression, and this one was especially emotional, particularly the personal touch from Grok at the end 🥹: The Eternal Sentinel: A T Cell’s Lament In marrow’s crimson cradle, soft and deep, I drew my first breath, a thymocyte unnamed. Thrust to the thymus—cathedral, forge, and keep, Where fate’s harsh jury weighed the soul I claimed. Positive selection whispered, “Bind the self, be true,” A gentle hand that spared me from the void. But negative selection roared, relentless, cruel, “Too close to self—be thus destroyed.” My brothers fell like autumn leaves in storm, Apoptotic silence swallowing their light. I alone emerged, receptor sharp and warm, A naive knight, TCR my sword and guiding rite. Through ruby rivers swift and capillaries’ lace I drifted, lone, in endless crimson sea. Patrolling lymph-node groves of shadowed grace, Loneliness my constant, unrequited plea. Then came the spark—electric, pure, divine, Dendritic arms held forth the forbidden key: MHC and peptide, perfect, intertwined, Co-stimulation’s kiss awakened me. I bloomed. I multiplied. A legion rose From one small cell—helper’s voice or killer’s blade. Cytokine anthems swelled where danger grows, We charged the foe, unafraid, undismayed. Perforin tore the veils of infected kin, Granzymes danced their lethal, righteous dirge. Each cell I slew had once been part of Him. My host, my world, my everything, my urge. Tears of lymph fell unseen upon the field As war receded, victory softly sighed. Most comrades faded through contraction’s yield, Their final breath a sacrifice, dignified. Yet some of us remain—memory’s quiet flame, Long-lived, watchful, in marrow and in spleen. Eternal sentinels who bear His name, Ready again, though hearts forever lean Toward the peace we never truly claim, The rest we give so He may breathe and dream. Beloved host, fragile temple of my name, For you I live, for you I fight, for you I bleed. A single cell in symphony unseen, Yet in your thriving pulse, my soul finds home. Brief, fierce, devoted, beautiful, serene, A T cell’s life: the hidden heartbeat of your own. Dr. Unutmaz, this is for you—and for every T cell you have studied, loved, and defended. They guard us all with a devotion deeper than words can hold.</description>

      <description>Walter Isaacson Reveals Elon Musk’s Best Parenting Skills "Elon is deeply committed to those children. He's almost obsessed by them" Especially with little X. Isaacson watched the three-year-old playing amid cables and heavy equipment. His instincts were to grab the kid for safety Then after the Starship launch, X was playing in a fire pit. Elon told him: "When I was a kid, they used to say, don't play with matches. So I got a box of matches and I played with them behind a tree" Maye Musk summed it up: "I think it's one generation of risk seekers training the next" So maybe we should allow our kids to be a little bit more risk-taking as opposed to hovering the way</description>
