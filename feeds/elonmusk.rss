      <description>Cathie Wood on Tesla and SpaceX: "This will be considered as the year of the RoboTaxi. We're also learning more about Elon Musk's plans for the moon, for solar powered data centers in Space, and for Mars, and you'll see a lot of what we expect for the next 20 to 25 years in our open source SpaceX model that came out around mid year and caused quite a stir. We also had a great year in terms of space exploration. SpaceX made all kinds of announcements and is delivering service and Starlink throughout the world."</description>

      <description>ACADEMIC ALARM: Alumnus backs professor who quit Harvard after 40 years over the university's embrace of DEI policies, which he argues sidelines merit in favor of ideology. "It’s shocking, but it’s certainly not surprising."</description>

      <description>FLASHBACK: NYT columnist Wajahat Ali launched an anti white rant boasting of demographic conquest while Democrats and the drive by media celebrate him, despite his own family’s $29M Microsoft fraud convictions. Ali told white Americans “you have lost,” bragged that immigrants “breed” and “take over,” and mocked Western culture, music, and women, even as his Pakistani parents were convicted of conspiracy, mail fraud, wire fraud, and money laundering tied to a $29M academic software scam.</description>

      <description>Here is: Soros Foundations report from 1993 showing Soros had just signed a cooperative agreement with USAID to groom puppets, topple government and destroy western civilization. —- The Soros Foundations Management Training Program ("SFMP*) received and signed Cooperative Agreement#EUR0045 A 00 4007 00 from the United States Agency for International Development (USAID*) on November 19, 1993. In all five countries, advertisement and recruitment began immediately. Ads were placed in the newspaper in Poland, Romania and Slovakia. In all five countries. Coordinators distributed application packets to other organizations that included other development agencies, USAID-funded projects, banks, companies, branch offices of the Foundations themselves, small business associations, Chambers of commerce and more. In Bulgaria, Estonia, Romania and Slovakia, SMTP coordinators drew on a database of pre-screened applications that had been gathered in earlier advertising campaigns for the other opportunities for training abroad that SFMTP offers.</description>

      <description>The Era of Suicidal Empathy in Western Civilization is Officially Over. We have had ENOUGH. Watching an ungrateful, repulsive Somali pirate influencer threaten to kill Elon Musk for exposing billions of her people’s fraud, and then laughing about it — this was the end for me.@elonmusk’s response: “This is war.” He’s right. He’s seen where this leads. The same corruption and looting that destroyed South Africa is being imported here. This ends one way: - STOP third-world immigration - REPEAL the failed laws that allowed it - DENATURALIZE and DEPORT hostile fraudsters No more excuses. No more empathy for people who loot and hate us.</description>

      <link>https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/c260125b</link>
      <description>Here it is: USAID not only facilitated the overthrow of foreign countries, but also operations here at home: Barack Obama covertly funneled $1.2 billion through USAID that was supposedly designated for Pakistan as “humanitarian aid,” but instead laundered it through the Cayman Islands to help overthrow the Cuban government. Similarly, USAID funneled $27 million to the “rent-a-riots” terrorist group Black Lives Matter through the Tides Foundation—a George Soros–backed terrorist organization—which helped overthrow the United States government leading up to the 2020 presidential election. Here is:@MikeBenzCyberdiscussing how Obama funded a social media platform—a Twitter clone—that was used to push propaganda in Cuba, inspire protests, and then leverage that funding to train and deploy “rent-a-riots” for protests aimed at overthrowing governments. Mike Benz: “A scandal during the Obama USAID era. We were running a number of rogue USAID operations in Cuba at the time. USAID pumped $1.2 billion in, and we sponsored these activist groups and these civil society organizations to learn how to use Facebook, learn how to use Twitter, learn how to use hashtags, and learn how to coordinate street protests so that everyone knew where to go, which streets to show up on, and what slogans to use in order to create the pro-democracy predicate for it. You’re using Cayman Islands bank accounts. You’re saying it’s earmarked for Pakistani aid. But the money was never sent to Pakistan—it was sent to the Cayman Islands to fund this whole operation.”</description>
