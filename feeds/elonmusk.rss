      <description>This should be the 1 congressional priority: &gt; in 15 states, you don't have to show **any** ID to vote &gt; 69% of liberal voters support photo ID requirements, but only one democratic senator has voted for the Save Act &gt; either voter ID is mandated now, or, whenever the senate next flips, the opposite will happen (mandated no-ID voting across the US) If the bill doesn't pass now, it would be an absolute disaster for electoral security, and would likely essentially create a permanent one-party state Huge bi-partisan support. It's just a common-sense requirement. The bill is stuck due to the zombie filibuster - where the minority can refuse to vote, without even standing and talking End the filibuster and pass the bill!</description>

      <description>🚨NEW: Elon Musk explains the reason behind the SpaceX and xAI merger. "In order to understand the universe, you must explore the universe. That's the motivation behind the combination of SpaceX and xAI is to accelerate humanity's future in understanding the universe and extending the light of consciousness to the stars. So in the grand scheme of things, when you look at how much energy Earth is actually using for civilization, we're only right now using, call it roughly 1% of the potential energy of Earth. And if we wanted to use even a millionth of the sun's energy, that would be roughly a million times more energy than civilization currently uses. The only way to access that energy, the energy of the sun is to extend beyond Earth. Earth is really a tiny, tiny dust Mote in a vast darkness. The sun is 99.8% of all mass in the solar system, so you have to expand beyond the tiny dust mode that is earth to make any significant dent in using the sun's energy like says, you'd have to expand roughly a million times just to get to 1,000,000th of our sun's energy, and then going beyond that, exploring extending to the Galaxy. So the the next step beyond Earth data centers is our Earth orbital data centers, and we'll be launching with SpaceX orbital data centers at the 100 to 200 gigawatt per year level, not cumulative, I mean, per year. And ultimately, we see a path to maybe launching as much as a terawatt per year of compute from Earth."</description>

      <description>Milton Friedman on 4 ways to spend money: 1) Your money on yourself (you’re careful about both cost and quality) 2) Your money on others (you care about cost, less about quality) 3) Someone else’s money on yourself (you care about quality, not cost) 4) Someone else’s money on others (you care about neither) The last one is how government spending works</description>

      <description>Dems are calling requiring Voter ID “racist” and “Jim Crow 2.0”. Some Black populations of countries that require Voter ID to vote: Haiti: 95% Jamaica: 92% Kenya: 99% Ghana: 99% Botswana: 90% South Africa: 81% Brazil: 56% I wonder if they know theyre racist towards themselves?</description>

      <description>It's amazing that a simple idea, such as the slope of a tangent line could have so many incredible consequences. Modern calculus was developed ~365 years ago.</description>

      <description>Keynesian economists perform elaborate mathematical gymnastics to "prove" that $1 of government spending magically becomes $1.50 of economic growth. This fiscal multiplier fairy tale ignores what Bastiat called the "unseen" - the productive investments that never happen because resources were seized by bureaucrats first. Every bridge to nowhere represents a thousand private innovations strangled in their cribs. The seen stimulus creates jobs for government contractors and ribbon-cutting ceremonies for politicians. The unseen is the cancer research, the small businesses, the breakthrough technologies that die stillborn because capital was diverted to political pet projects. Modern economies don't multiply wealth through redistribution any more than you create water by moving it between buckets.</description>

      <description>xAI was reorganized a few days ago to improve speed of execution. As a company grows, especially as quickly as xAI, the structure must evolve just like any living organism. This unfortunately required parting ways with some people. We wish them well in future endeavors. We are hiring aggressively. Join xAI if the idea of mass drivers on the Moon appeals to you.</description>
