      <description>Great quote from Cicero: ”A nation can survive its fools, and even the ambitious. But it cannot survive treason from within. An enemy at the gates is less formidable, for he is known and he carries his banners openly. But the traitor moves among those within the gate freely, his sly whispers rustling through all the galleys, heard in the very hall of government itself. For the traitor appears not traitor - he speaks in the accents familiar to his victims, and wears their face and their garments, and he appeals to the baseness that lies deep in the hearts of all men. He rots the soul of a nation - he works secretly and unknown in the night to undermine the pillars of a city - he infects the body politic so that it can no longer resist. A murderer is less to be feared.”</description>

      <description>Why X Chat is Better Than Signal: 1. All-in-one integration: Seamlessly connected to the X platform for quick chats from posts, replies, and communities—no need to switch apps. 2. No phone number required: Message anyone on X directly without sharing personal phone details (unlike Signal’s traditional setup). 3. Advanced features: Full encryption for files (up to large sizes), vanishing messages, edit/delete options, audio/video calls, and screenshot protection—built for modern, everyday use. 4. More reliable: Not dependent on centralized services that can go down during outages; designed as part of a robust super-app ecosystem. 5. Convenience for real conversations: Where your network already is—faster adoption and richer interactions without forcing contacts to download a separate app.</description>

      <description>Meet Abdi Daisane, a Somali daycare owner running for Minnesota Congress as a Democrat. His Blooming Kids Child Care Center has racked up 82 violations in 3 years, including having just ONE chair for 150+ kids—while pocketing millions in taxpayer funds. This gets worse every day. Can you believe this guy's about to be in office?</description>

      <description>America spends $7.8B monthly on SNAP. If ILLEGALS were removed from SNAP the cost would reduce 70%. If all benefits were CUT OFF they would LEAVE. 45% of ALL AFGHANI’s living in America receive FREE FOOD from YOU. Is this your American dream? Cause if sure isn't mine.</description>

      <description>When the math is done, we will most likely realize our entire national deficit is comprised of these Somali scams, coupled with the other NGO grifts of the Democrat Party. In a nutshell: conservative taxpayers are working to fund Democrats and the parasites they’ve imported.</description>
