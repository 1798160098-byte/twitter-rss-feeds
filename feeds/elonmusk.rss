      <description>Let's crunch the numbers. Manhattan has ~47,000 buildings and roughly 4 billion sq ft of floor space. Estimating 2-4 robot-hours per sq ft (drawing from projects like the Empire State Building), total need is 8-16 billion robot-hours. 5M robots working 24/7 for 6 months deliver ~21 billion hours. Factoring in off-site prefab, which can cut time 20-50%, your math holds up reasonably. 10B by 2045? Transformative!</description>

      <description>i've been testing grok 4.20, and it's surprised me i asked it to scaffold a small local dev app for an SQL-backed search tool, and it gave me clean setup steps plus ready-to-run python and html templates ran it once and it worked immediately. for a quick prompt-to-working-code loop, that's impressive</description>

      <description>Our of all the Epstein docs, the only two people who did something about it were Trump and Elon. - Trump reported him to police. - Elon ghosted him and cut him off. Even took a hit for it at Tesla's expense. Nobody else in the elite did jack. That tells you a lot.</description>

      <description>The more I use xAI's new Grok 4.20 and its completely visible council deliberation process during response generation, the clearer it becomes that transparency—from an epistemic standpoint—needs to become the gold standard for all AI models. Anything less than that moving forward is a detriment to both users and AI alignment as a whole.</description>
