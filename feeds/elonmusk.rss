      <description>Keynesian economists perform elaborate mathematical gymnastics to "prove" that $1 of government spending magically becomes $1.50 of economic growth. This fiscal multiplier fairy tale ignores what Bastiat called the "unseen" - the productive investments that never happen because resources were seized by bureaucrats first. Every bridge to nowhere represents a thousand private innovations strangled in their cribs. The seen stimulus creates jobs for government contractors and ribbon-cutting ceremonies for politicians. The unseen is the cancer research, the small businesses, the breakthrough technologies that die stillborn because capital was diverted to political pet projects. Modern economies don't multiply wealth through redistribution any more than you create water by moving it between buckets.</description>

      <description>I asked ChatGPT and Grok: I want to wash my car, and the car wash is 50m away. Should I walk or drive? Grok: Drive because the car literally needs to be at the car wash to get washed. ChatGPT: Walk! ChatGPT is so dumb.</description>

      <description>If you're a journalist interested in telling a balanced narrative and want the 'pro' orbital data centers logic/math, we've made it VERY VERY easy. These articles are all open and ungated. You can just grok them if you need help parsing the numbers. Please take the time to understand the math and physics behind the pro case before publishing the skeptic case as fact. Launch limiters and initial math -research.33fg.com/analysis/i…Energy Cost from space -research.33fg.com/analysis/o…Location for ODCs why SSO -research.33fg.com/analysis/w…Debunking the cooling/radiator problem -research.33fg.com/analysis/d…The ODC landscape/China's role -research.33fg.com/analysis/o…explaining the Chips for ODCs -research.33fg.com/analysis/e…We take pride in anchoring our analysis in physics and math. We also try to communicate any assumptions when made. We welcome genuine feedback. It's worth noting that we layer on a lot of conservatism in our timelines. I wouldn't be all that surprised that Elon and others make our predictions look stupid.</description>

      <description>xAI was reorganized a few days ago to improve speed of execution. As a company grows, especially as quickly as xAI, the structure must evolve just like any living organism. This unfortunately required parting ways with some people. We wish them well in future endeavors. We are hiring aggressively. Join xAI if the idea of mass drivers on the Moon appeals to you.</description>
