      <description>"For a while there, I was just sleeping under my desk, which is out in the open in the factory, for an important reason. And it was damn uncomfortable sleeping on that floor always when I woke up, I’d smell like metal dust I stopped using the couch in the little conference room and just slept on the floor under my desk so that during shift change, the entire team could see me And that’s important because if they think that their leader is off somewhere having a good time, drinking Mai Tais on a tropical island which I definitely could have been doing and would much have preferred to do I’m not actually a masochist, I think the thing is that since the team could see me sleeping on the floor during shift change, they knew I was there. And that made a huge difference" - ELON MUSK</description>

      <description>Democrats are using this as an opportunity to smear Elon. No one has done more to fight child exploitation and trafficking than Elon. He risked his life and fortune to get the Epstein files released. X routinely suspends millions of accounts for CP.</description>

      <description>Epstein wasn’t just trafficking girls; he was in talks about pushing radical gender ideology. Emails show they were pitching him on “trans children” and how to normalize it.</description>

      <description>The irony is unreal U.S. Department of Justice just dropped ~3 million pages of Jeffrey Epstein files, thousands of images, hundreds of videos A big reason this even happened is Elon Musk, who’s been relentlessly calling for actual prosecutions of everyone who committed these crimes Yet the woke media spent the whole day obsessing over emails where Epstein was pestering Elon Musk to attend his party, with Elon clearly brushing him off, and then they spin the story the other way around Where are the questions for the people actually in the videos? Where are the prosecutions? Where are the arrests? Literally zero arrests. Three million files and not a single handcuff for the real predators The media is using Elon as a distraction, keeping the spotlight on a billionaire they love to hate instead of demanding justice for the powerful figures who were actually on that island and are named throughout these files They’re now literally targeting Elon to taint his reputation, while the real predators walk free Never trust the legacy media. They’ve become one of the most corrupt forces on the planet</description>

      <description>Elon Musk has consistently raised the issue of holding Epstein's clients accountable. He's one of the voices that has kept the noise around this matter alive, preventing those with access to the evidence from concealing it: “I think the public will be rightly frustrated if no one is prosecuted for the Epstein client list. No one at all. Some number should at least be an attempted prosecution of the worst offenders. [If Ghislaine Maxwell is in jail for sex trafficking], that means sex trafficking occurred. So, who were the clients? So the proof is there. I mean, there's lots of videos. Whenever they raided Epstein's place, there would have been like a mountain of evidence. Where is that mountain? Like, who took possession of the evidence? Specifically.” Video:@MarioNawfal</description>

      <description>Nobody has fought harder for full release of the Epstein files and prosecutions of those who abused children more than I did, knowing full well that the legacy media, far-left propagandists and those who are actually guilty would: 1. Admit nothing 2. Deny everything 3. Make counter-accusations against me I knew that I would be smeared relentlessly, despite never having attended his parties or been on his “Lolita Express” plane or set foot on his creepy island or done anything wrong at all. Nonetheless, the extreme pain of being accused of being the opposite of who I am was worth it. The strong must protect those cannot protect themselves, especially vulnerable children. I will gladly accept any amount of future pain to do more to protect kids and give them a chance to grow up and have happy lives.</description>
