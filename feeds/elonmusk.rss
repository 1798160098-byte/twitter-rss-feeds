      <description>Grok is beating ChatGPT because a lot of normies are discovering Grok now. On TikTok there are people making Grok edits where they ask a question, ChatGPT says something dumb, Grok is way more human and smart. This one has over 300k likes. There are hundreds of them. And the comments are filled with pro Grok replies.</description>

      <description>Governor Walz has provided oversight over one of the largest and most pervasive frauds in our country’s history. As such, he is not only not electable, he likely needs time to prepare for his defense for the potential criminal charges he may face. This was not a difficult decision for him. It was the only decision he could make in light of his circumstances.</description>

      <description>I can confirm public speculation that Ambassador Abukar Dahir Osman, Permanent Representative of Somalia to the UN and President of the Security Council, is in fact associated with Progressive Health Care Services, a home health agency in Cincinnati. HHS has previously taken action against Progressive in response to a conviction for Medicaid fraud. More to come.@HHSGov</description>

      <description>David Sacks: As part of this investigation, someone needs to explain why three liberal judges repeatedly refused to hold Somali fraudsters accountable — even after overwhelming evidence and jury convictions. Setting aside convictions isn’t justice, it’s sabotage. If the system protects fraud instead of punishing it, the system itself becomes complicit.</description>

      <link>https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/95e6dc77</link>
      <description>Creative Minds Daycare was shut down on October 1, 2025, due to multiple licensing violations identified by the Minnesota Department of Human Services (DHS). These included issues like inadequate supervision, safety hazards, and record-keeping failures. The center reopened the very next day, October 2, 2025, under the new name Super Kids Daycare at the same address, using what appears to be the same or a transferred license. In fiscal year 2025 (which ran from July 1, 2024, to June 30, 2025), Super Kids Daycare received approximately $2.45 million in payments through Minnesota's Child Care Assistance Program. Who is the owner of this "daycare"? State Sen. Omar Fateh's brother-in-law, Mohamud Muse. Muse, who volunteered for the campaign of DFL State Sen. Omar Fateh (his brother-in-law), admitted to collecting ballots from voters but falsely denied under oath that he had paid or coerced anyone. He was convicted in May 2022 of one count of perjury for lying to a federal grand jury about his role in handling and delivering absentee ballots during the August 2020 primary election in Minneapolis.</description>

      <description>The fraud in California, New York and Illinois is far greater than in Minnesota. My guess for how much fraud is happening nationwide is roughly 10% of the Federal budget, so about $700 billion per year.</description>
