      <description>The Era of Suicidal Empathy in Western Civilization is Officially Over. We have had ENOUGH. Watching an ungrateful, repulsive Somali pirate influencer threaten to kill Elon Musk for exposing billions of her people’s fraud, and then laughing about it — this was the end for me.@elonmusk’s response: “This is war.” He’s right. He’s seen where this leads. The same corruption and looting that destroyed South Africa is being imported here. This ends one way: - STOP third-world immigration - REPEAL the failed laws that allowed it - DENATURALIZE and DEPORT hostile fraudsters No more excuses. No more empathy for people who loot and hate us.</description>

      <link>https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/985b874e</link>
      <description>Here it is: USAID not only facilitated the overthrow of foreign countries, but also operations here at home: Barack Obama covertly funneled $1.2 billion through USAID that was supposedly designated for Pakistan as “humanitarian aid,” but instead laundered it through the Cayman Islands to help overthrow the Cuban government. Similarly, USAID funneled $27 million to the “rent-a-riots” terrorist group Black Lives Matter through the Tides Foundation—a George Soros–backed terrorist organization—which helped overthrow the United States government leading up to the 2020 presidential election. Here is:@MikeBenzCyberdiscussing how Obama funded a social media platform—a Twitter clone—that was used to push propaganda in Cuba, inspire protests, and then leverage that funding to train and deploy “rent-a-riots” for protests aimed at overthrowing governments. Mike Benz: “A scandal during the Obama USAID era. We were running a number of rogue USAID operations in Cuba at the time. USAID pumped $1.2 billion in, and we sponsored these activist groups and these civil society organizations to learn how to use Facebook, learn how to use Twitter, learn how to use hashtags, and learn how to coordinate street protests so that everyone knew where to go, which streets to show up on, and what slogans to use in order to create the pro-democracy predicate for it. You’re using Cayman Islands bank accounts. You’re saying it’s earmarked for Pakistani aid. But the money was never sent to Pakistan—it was sent to the Cayman Islands to fund this whole operation.”</description>

      <description>Starlink had an amazing year in 2025, and 2026 is looking to be even crazier. They added 38 new regions, doubled their active customers, added 270 Tbps of capacity and reached other milestones like completing the V1 of the D2C network. 2 days ago, they released their annual "Starlink Progress Report". This 75 page long PDF contains a lot of information, and is super interesting to read. Here is a thread that summarizes everything.</description>

      <description>Why is the Overton windows shifting so fast right now? Because it was hold back by force. If your surpress a organic debate with censorship and violence, it will explode, as soon as people lose fear. We are no longer afraid. Your time is over.</description>

      <description>“Some people out there may be somewhat skeptical. They may think, well, there isn't some Democrat plan to subvert democracy and achieve a permanent one-party, deep blue socialist state. I assure you, the more you research it, the more you will see it is true.” Elon Musk</description>
