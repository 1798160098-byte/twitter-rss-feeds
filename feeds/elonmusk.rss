      <description>To be clear, I think we should only waive the filibuster to pass an election integrity act into law, but not for any other reason. Election integrity must include visual ID that proves citizenship and in-person voting (except in extreme circumstances like troops overseas).</description>

      <description>Go scroll this thread to see the child rapists, thugs and terrorists that the Trump Admin has been taking down in Minneapolis. THESE MONSTERS are who the Democrats have been out on the streets defending as they try to STOP law enforcement from doing their jobs. Insane.</description>

      <description>How long &amp; complicated can the deportation process be? Remember this Haitian gang member w/ 17 convictions who went viral for yelling “Fuck Trump, Biden forever” during my embed with ICE Boston 1 year ago? He’s still in ICE custody in the US. Despite having a deportation order, I’m told he continues to use every legal avenue &amp; appeal to try to avoid deportation. He is currently detained by ICE at a facility in Louisiana. We witnessed him get arrested by ICE in Boston on 1/22/25.</description>

      <description>MS-13 Illegals Just Hacked a 14-Year-Old to Death in Maryland: To the activists and politicians chanting “abolish ICE” — do this one thing: Look the 14-year-old’s mother in the face and say it. Say you don’t support the agency that exists to deport violent criminals before innocent lives are taken. Four illegal aliens connected to MS-13 were arrested in Maryland after allegedly hacking a 14-year-old boy to d*ath with a machete. This isn’t political theory. This isn’t rhetoric. This is a child who will never come home and a mother left to bury her son. This is why we stand with ICE. So violent criminals are removed before they destroy families. So tragedies like this don’t happen.</description>
