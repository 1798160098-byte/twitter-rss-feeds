      <description>Dacara Thompson was sexually assaulted by an illegal alien. He brutalized her in ways that would make any Hollywood horror movie seem like Sesame Street. While Dacara clung to life, he took her battered body and he threw her off a bridge! BLM never protested for her. Race hustlers like Benjamin Crump, Al Sharpton, and Dominque Alexander remained stone-cold silent. Jimmy Kimmel said nothing. Liberal influencers still don’t know who she is. Not one liberal or democrat chanted “SAY HER NAME!” Not a single one. The mainstream media buried her story EXTREMELY fast too. It was gone before the sun came up. Dacara Thompson was a mother too!!! Her killer’s actions made her 2 year old son an orphan, YET NOT A SINGLE Democrat posted about her.</description>

      <description>The UN Permanent Forum on People of African Descent operated as a front for radical DEI activists who lobbied for race-based wealth redistribution and sought to hold a UN tribunal to compel Americans to pay reparations. The United States is withdrawing from this UN forum.</description>

      <description>Investigation traced George Soros funding to 54 groups directly linked to domestic terrorism Here’s where it gets crazy, each one of those groups also networks with as many as 300 separate entities orchestrating terrorism “We traced over $80 million going from the Open Society Foundations to at least 54 groups engaged in crime and domestic terrorism on US soil or that are pro-terrorism — according to his own files, so it's rock solid” - Over $23 million, went to at least 7 groups that are doing things that meet the FBI's definition of domestic terrorism George Soros linked to training terrorists on American soil “The Center for Third World Organizing, for example, is an organization that has a hub that fuse together several,, really extreme organizations. We found $400,000 going to them and they openly boast of the fact that they threw down during the uprisings in Minnesota, obviously referring to the rioting and boasting of how many thousands of people they helped train. A lot of these groups have created what they'll call, like, a protest guide or an activism toolkit” “Things like property destruction, violence, false IDs, how to obstruct justice, all of these things” “When I say 54 groups, just one of those might have 300 entities — actually, the real number is actually much higher” This is the definition of racketeering</description>

      <description>🚨 IT'S OFFICIAL: The federal government is now investigating hundreds of MILLIONS of Somali dollars leaving through the Minneapolis MN airport Wow. Someone MUST go to prison for this. "There are Somali couriers who come to the airport almost daily with $1,600,000 in cash in a luggage. That sounds a little suspicious, right?" "It was going on daily, and they were moving about $350 million a year in cash in their luggage out of Minneapolis airport and then traditionally or predominantly overseas." "One of the routes that TSA saw the money go, it would go from Minneapolis to Europe, Europe to Dubai, often through Amsterdam. It was flagged for years. TSA was flagging these payments for years." "They grew. They grew from $20, $30 million a year to $350 million a year in the last two years, 2024 and 2025." "It was literally a foreign ATM taking cash out of the United States to foreign destinations. We don't know the reason why, but that is now under investigation by the FBI and HSI. People say, well, is this normal?!" -@jsolomonReports📽️@JustTheNews</description>

      <description>Elon Musk: Some fundamental things must happen, or Germany will fail. “The reason that I am in favor of AfD is that there are some fundamental things that must happen, without which I'm concerned that Germany will fail. There have to be sensible controls on immigration. If there are criminals in Germany who are committing crimes and hurting people in Germany, they must be deported, and that's not happening. Then, there must also be freedom of speech, such that the people know what the truth is. If you do not have freedom of speech, you cannot be a democracy because the public cannot make an informed decision about their vote. In Germany right now, there are draconian laws, rules against freedom of expression, where even insulting a politician can get you prison time, which is insane. So, I like the fact that the AfD is in favor of freedom of speech. I like that the AfD is in favor of sensible immigration policies, and deportation of criminals. And I like the generally libertarian policies of the AfD.” From: WELT Economic Summit, January 28, 2025</description>

      <description>This is xAI’s new Colossus 3 building. Combined with Colossus 1 and 2, xAI’s total datacenter footprint is estimated at ~2.5M sqft. Together, the three sites will form a nearly 2GW supercomputer, with well over 1 million GPUs, likely costing over $35B combined. Insane scale.</description>

      <description>A nation that cannot say who belongs within its borders is no nation at all. Mass immigration was never an accident. It is policy, and it is being used to dilute identity, suppress wages, and weaken national unity.</description>

      <link>https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/10f7855e</link>
      <description>Look…It's not that hard. The left just wants to live in an environment where taxes are high, the regulations are plentiful, the property is collective and the economy centrally planned… No one has guns except the police, who no longer exist because no one is illegal so prisons aren't needed. The men are women, the women are men and the kids are trans… The day care centers are plentiful, but kids are not, because abortion is free. All lives matter except for straight white males who are literally Hitler and land acknowledgments are spoken before every sporting event where the score is never kept… And the rest of us? Well the rest of us would like to live somewhere about as opposite to what I just described as possible. So maybe it's time to just divvy up the states between us. Allow everyone the option to move to one zone or the other and then conduct the same kind of experiment that North and South Korea did… Then we can check back in 30 years and figure out which one is a thriving high trust society and which one is a degenerate failed state incapable of being seen from space at night…except maybe for the mostly peaceful glow of its cities burning to the ground.</description>

Then he gets done for fucking about with a kid, sent to prison and deported, ( this couldn’t happen now, we haven’t deported anyone to Kurdistan in 13 years ) he then applies to come back appealing on family grounds, he has a wife and kids here! Problem his wife don’t want him back and won’t support his application!
