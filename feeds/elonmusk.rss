      <description>Hundreds of millions of dollars from Minnesota have funded radical Islamic terror in Somalia. It’s so bad that the MN taxpayer is the largest source of funds for the Somali terror group Al-Shabaab. I’ll be chairing a Senate Judiciary hearing to fight this fraud.</description>

      <description>Actual innocent women and mothers are killed every day in this country by lawless thugs with 20+ prior arrests, still walking the streets because some woke judge has more compassion for violent animals than law abiding citizens. The people weeping over Renee Good never say a word about any of those victims. No candlelight vigils. No mass outrage. No protests. And we’re supposed to take their grief seriously? As if these people are even capable of sincere human emotion at this point? Give me a break.</description>

      <description>It is obviously fair and normal to ask for receipts before blindly wiring money or fraud will grow to infinity! The blue states are suing for one reason: to keep the fraud going.</description>

      <description>Suddenly the UK Government are cracking down on sexually abusive images...and have chosen to target X Not the myriad porn websites that disseminate billions of misogynistic, violent and paedophilic content Not Snapchat which is often used by creeps trying to groom kids No. The platform that has become the UK's number one news source. I am a vehement campaigner against pornification and for women's safety, but I'm frankly not buying this This is gaslighting and deception to create faux moral outrage while the mad Commies literally shut down free society and censor information</description>

      <description>My grandparents on my mother’s side were from England. They immigrated to Moose Jaw, Saskatchewan, Canada when they were 19 years old. I have relatives in England. It used to be lovely and safe. It is worth saving.</description>

      <link>https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/73c35c84</link>
      <description>STATEMENT TO MY AUDIENCE If this is one of the last posts you ever see from British Intel on X, then I owe you a direct and honest explanation. First and foremost, I have worked relentlessly to build a British news and analysis page from the ground up, with little personal gain and a great deal of sacrifice. I feel deeply sorry for everyone who now stands to lose their livelihood, their platform, or their voice as a result of the actions of a corrupt government. Independent analysts, journalists, creators, and small businesses did not cause this - but they will pay the price. What is happening now has gone far beyond child protection, regulation, or safety. This is about control. X has become the one major platform where the government cannot fully manage the narrative, where ordinary people expose corruption, incompetence, hypocrisy, and failure in real time. That is why it is being targeted. Not because it is uniquely dangerous, but because it is uniquely uncontrollable. I am angry. I am defiant. And I am not backing down from saying this is a disgrace. No mandate. No vote. No public consent. Millions opposed. And still they push ahead. This government is testing how far it can go. Banning a major news platform used by millions of Britons is not a minor policy choice. It is an attack on democratic discourse itself. You do not protect democracy by switching it off. You do not defend freedom by banning debate. We must fight this government politically, lawfully, and relentlessly. That means pressure. That means peaceful resistance. That means refusing to accept censorship. That means backing candidates and movements that defend free speech, not manage it into extinction. If this account goes quiet, understand this: it is not because I gave up. It is because the line was crossed by those in power, not by those speaking out. Thank you to every single person who stood with this account, challenged it, supported it, and believed that truth matters. Whatever comes next, do not let them convince you that silence is safety, or that obedience is virtue. This has gone too far. British Intel</description>
