      <description>Travelling to America as an Australian is terrifying. Because living in Australia, we're sheltered. We're far from the rest of the world. Our State Sponsored Media tells you that Australia has the best of everything in the world. That our culture and lifestyle is unmatched. But as soon as you arrive in America it is blindingly obvious how false that is. America feels explosive, alive, chaotic, rich. It's loud, obnoxious, unapologetic. There's no hint of tall poppy syndrome. And no constant nagging of the Nanny State. America is accelerating into an unknown future without fear. There are so many technological innovations here that would never see the light of day in Australia, because they would be strangled by regulation. Australia is beautiful, sure. But it's safe, quiet, controlled. Media and society tell you to conform, comply, be seen and not heard. Take the safe option. Be fearful of new things. Be fearful of the future. The spark of innovation is stifled. The light of creativity is discouraged. The warmth of the collective is more important than the rugged individual. And as time goes on, one of the two countries is going to be left behind. It's pretty clear which country that is. So, it's terrifying. And before I came here, everyone said I should be terrified of America. That I wouldn't be let it the country. That everyone is rioting. That Hitler runs the country. That couldn't be further from the truth. Their brains have been absolutely fried by Australian State Sponsored media.</description>

      <description>EVERY SINGLE BLM/anti-ICE story is like this. So, there are two separate components here. (1) Good faith people CAN actually disagree on the division of fault in all such cases. We have courts to decide that, and we'll see at least civil matters in every case here. (2) It is Very Very Very Very easy not to get shot by the police. The Renee Good situation is accurately broken down below. Similarly, Jacob Blake, the most famous BLM case after Floyd and Brown, was a rapist who fought cops with a hunting knife on him while trying to steal a car full of kids. Hard to feel anything close to full sympathy.</description>

      <description>Jonathan Ross, Founder and CEO of AI chip company Groq, offers a contrarian view: AI won't destroy jobs, it will create a labour shortage. He outlines three things that will happen because of AI: First, massive deflationary pressure. "This cup of coffee is going to cost less. Your housing is going to cost less. Everything is going to cost less." He explains this will happen through robots farming coffee more efficiently and better supply chain management, meaning people will need less money. Second, people will opt out of the economy. "They're going to work fewer hours. They're going to work fewer days a week, and they're going to work fewer years. They're going to retire earlier because they're going to be able to support their lifestyle working less." Third, entirely new jobs and industries will emerge. Jonathan points to history as evidence: "Think about 100 years ago. 98% of the workforce in the United States was in agriculture. When we were able to reduce that to 2%, we found things for those other 98% of the population to do." He continues: "The jobs that are going to exist 100 years from now, we can't even contemplate." Software developers didn't exist a century ago. In another century, they won't exist either, "because everyone's going to be vibe coding." The same applies to influencers, a career that would have been unthinkable 100 years ago but now earns people millions. His conclusion: deflationary pressure, workforce opt-outs, and new industries we can't yet imagine will combine to create one outcome... "We're not going to have enough people."</description>

      <description>Seattle Mayor Katie Wilson explicitly confirms she will NOT investigate claims of Somali daycare fraud She says investigating the massive theft of millions in taxpayer money is just "dividing and conquering" and refuses to ask police to look into it 🤡 Apparently, investigating potential massive taxpayer theft is now considered "targeting"</description>

      <description>First it was Mamdani in New York City, placing his hand on the Quran, while being sworn in as Mayor. Now it’s Virginia’s Lt. Governor being sworn in using the Quran. Do you get it now? This is exactly how they took over the United Kingdom.</description>

      <description>This is great. The two critical factors for voting integrity and saving democracy in America are simply requiring ID and in-person voting! The last one is super important. Mail-in voting should only be for troops overseas or a serious medical condition.</description>
