      <description>Reid Hoffman is lying. He has not been cleared by the FBI and should be investigated. - 1737 emails - Confirmed visits to the Epstein Island - Sent gifts to the island and “for the girls” - Stayed at Epstein’s island, Epstein’s ranch in New Mexico and Epstein’s house in New York. - Offered to help him with PR. - Lying about his relationship with Epstein - Maintained very close relationship with Epstein right up to the end. • July 2015: Epstein texts Hoffman praising his diet progress. Hoffman replies he's making "slow progress" and is "planning to see him in August." • April 2016: Dinner reservation at upscale Palo Alto sushi restaurant. • April 29, 2016: Scheduled meeting at MIT. • June 20, 2016: Skype call. • June 25, 2016: "Phone date." • July 24, 2016: In-person meeting in Bedford, NY. • Sept 30, 2017: Hoffman emails Epstein after hurricane hits USVI: "You good?" • March 24, 2018: One-on-one Skype call. • March 16, 2019: Google notification suggests possible meeting that morning.</description>

      <description>Katherine Boyle just identified Elon Musk’s most important contribution to America, and it has nothing to do with the products he shipped. Boyle, General Partner at a16z: “I think Elon’s most important contribution to this country is training two generations of engineers to work with their hands again.” For ten years, America’s sharpest technical minds optimized ad clicks and built messaging apps. Software consumed ambition. The physical world became something you abstracted into APIs, not something you touched or understood. Elon didn’t reverse that through inspiration. He reversed it by building companies that required understanding manufacturing or failing completely. SpaceX and Tesla forced engineers to learn how metal fractures, how tolerances cascade through systems, how physical iteration costs months and millions per failure. No debugging. No patches. Just physics that doesn’t negotiate. Boyle: “Training two generations of engineers.” The product isn’t the cars. It’s the people. Look at who’s founding America’s critical hard-tech companies now. The common thread isn’t Stanford or MIT. It’s time on factory floors at SpaceX or Tesla. They learned welding. They learned that “impossible” just means unsolved engineering, not violated physics. They learned failure in the physical domain where mistakes compound instead of reverting. Elon didn’t build companies. He accidentally rebuilt industrial knowledge that had been decaying for thirty years while America’s best minds chased digital scale. Boyle: “Work with their hands again.” Three words that sound quaint but describe a civilizational inflection point. Software dominated because it scaled infinitely at zero marginal cost. Physical manufacturing was slow, expensive, unfashionable. Building real things became what you did if you couldn’t code. Elon made atoms matter again. Made manufacturing the hardest problem worth solving. Made physical engineering prestigious in ways it hadn’t been since humans walked on the moon. The evidence is everywhere now. Technical talent that doesn’t default to “which app” but asks “which physical thing should exist that currently doesn’t.” Ambition redirected from optimizing engagement metrics to building rockets. From scaling users to scaling factories. From virtual products to physical infrastructure. That shift matters more than any vehicle or spacecraft Musk delivered. Products obsolesce. Redirecting an entire generation’s engineering ambition from digital to physical compounds across decades and rebuilds industrial capability at civilizational scale. We stopped just coding the future. We started machining it, welding it, breaking it in reality until physics confirms it works. That transformation from virtual to tangible ambition is reconstructing American manufacturing one engineer at a time. And those engineers are now training the next wave. The compounding has started. The School of Elon doesn’t need Elon anymore. It’s self-sustaining, spreading through an entire generation that learned building real things matters more than building virtual ones. That’s not just a business achievement. That’s a civilization remembering how to make things that matter in the physical world again. And it might be the only thing that saves American technological leadership when the competition is just building faster because they never forgot.</description>

      <description>From 2021-2024, Democrats exercised total control over US immigration policy. They willfully create the largest and deadliest tsunami of illegal immigration, child sex trafficking, drug trafficking and gang infiltration in history. These are the Democrats now shutting down DHS.</description>

      <description>Because everyone’s job is safety. It’s not some fake department with no power to assuage the concerns of outsiders. Tesla has no safety team and is the safest car. SpaceX has no safety team and has the safest rocket. Dragon is what NASA trusts most to fly astronauts.</description>
