      <description>So after 3 days of driving all around Salt Lake area in a Tesla Y, I'm going to give my opinion on it... I love it, and I want one. That's the main takeaway. I've had it in a few anxiety inducing situations, and I restrained myself from grabbing the steering wheel. It performed flawlessly! I love the look of the door handles, but I don't really love the way they function. And I do notice that it is not a timid little car. It's pretty assertive in traffic, and I like that. But sometimes it tends to go over the speed limit. I just let it do it's thing. I had two hands on my coffee cup, and it told me to have my hands ready to drive! It also doesn't put up with me looking at my phone much which is a good thing. The technology is a bit of a learning curve, but my two grandsons ages 12 and 8 just tell me what to do. (It's humiliating.) My husband likes to be in control when he drives, so I don't know that we'll agree to get one anytime soon. But it's my dream to own one now!</description>

      <description>Just asked the four Grok 4.20 (Beta) agents to build me an artificial life simulator. My mind is blown. What should I get him to build next? &gt;&gt;&gt; grok prompt Build an artificial life simulator in one single HTML file. Hundreds of glowing neon particles in different cyberpunk colors. Each pair of colors has its own attraction/repulsion force that you control with sliders. You get emergent “creatures”, swarms, orbiting rings, exploding clusters, chasing packs, it feels alive. Features: - Click/drag to spawn particles of selected color - Real-time force matrix (6×6 sliders) - Randomize rules button (insane results every time) - Pause, speed, particle count, trails/glow toggle - Dark cyberpunk UI with scanlines + glitch effects optional</description>

      <description>Grok is most physically accurate of the four. Opus rear bike frame makes no sense structurally, there is no connection from pedals to rear wheel, both legs of Pelican are on the right side of the bike and handle bars are disconnected.</description>

      <description>Grok 4.2 will be about an order of magnitude smarter and faster than Grok 4 when the public beta concludes next month. Still many bug fixes and improvements landing every day. The public beta gives us more critical feedback to address.</description>

      <description>Right wing groups used Asian students to challenge race discrimination in college admissions because it’s taboo for White people to actually advocate for ourselves openly. This taboo must be destroyed. Anyone trying to weasel around this core issue is part of the problem.</description>
