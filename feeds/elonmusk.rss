      <description>South Africa is the country of my birth. Yet my countrymen chant “K*ll the Boer” songs about killing me because I'm white. The government doesn't mind the singing... or the killings. After all, the victims are white. This is my home. This is heartbreaking. This has gone on too long.@BrentBozell@marcorubio@elonmusk</description>

      <description>It seems as though immigration and voter ID laws are the two biggest issues for each party right now. One side is fighting for unchecked immigration and no voter ID. The other side is fighting for basic immigration laws and voter ID. It doesn’t take a genius to figure out what’s going on here.</description>

      <description>This gruesome murder was done by two illegal immigrants from Venezuela. I wasn’t even aware of it, in fact had to confirm. There are so many. But you never hear any pastors or the Pope or fake Christians call attention to this. It’s always how we are supposed to open the border.</description>

      <description>🚨 This woman nails it while Legacy media ignores it. “Did you guys hear about the illegal immigrant that was arrested in Georgia yesterday for brutally raping an 11-year-old girl at knifepoint and forcing her ten year old little sister to watch after breaking into their bedroom? Hmm, probably not, because you dumbasses have been so stuck on the five year old that was supposedly detained by ICE that with a 30 second Google search, you would have figured out that his dad actually ran and abandoned him and ICE wasn't going to leave a five-year-old by himself. You guys are so clinically stupid it hurts.”</description>
