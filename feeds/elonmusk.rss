      <description>Because everyone’s job is safety. It’s not some fake department with no power to assuage the concerns of outsiders. Tesla has no safety team and is the safest car. SpaceX has no safety team and has the safest rocket. Dragon is what NASA trusts most to fly astronauts.</description>

      <description>ELON: HERE’S WHY 𝕏 WILL SURPASS 1 BILLION DAILY ACTIVE USERS “While our monthly users are on average around 600 million, the number of people who have the X app installed is well over a billion. It's just that most people only occasionally come to the X app when there's some major world event. But, as we give people more reasons to use the X app—whether it's for communications, for Grok, or for X Money—we want it to be such that if you wanted to, you could live your life on the X app. As we make it more and more useful, we'll obviously give people compelling reasons to use the app every day. My expectation is we’ll have well over a billion daily active users.” Source:@elonmusk, xAI All-Hands, February 10, 2026</description>

      <description>“Elon always takes the high road. He will always do the hard things.”@nikitabierbreaks down what makes@elonmuskthe greatest operator alive: “At an Elon company—it’s a very flat organization.” “A large number of people direct report to Elon. Everyone has an incredible amount of agency.” “We come up with an idea, build it in a week, and it’s out. At Facebook, things would take months for approvals.” “I’ve never seen an executive with his amount of responsibility who is that deep in the weeds.” “He does weekly reviews with every engineer at the company. You present 1–2 slides: ‘What did you get done this week?’” “The amount of context switching he has to do between SpaceX, Tesla, xAI, X, Boring Company, and Neuralink— it’s incredible.” “When you’re a consumer product builder, you’re always looking for growth hacks. Quick wins. I’ll present those options— he’ll be like, ‘No. We’re going to do the hard thing.’” “A lot of these things seem impossible, but when he gives engineers the agency to do it, and says, ‘Let’s make it two weeks. Rebuild the algorithm in two weeks,’ amazing things happen. Miracles happen.” Via@lightspeedvp@mignano</description>

      <description>I feel I need to comment on this because I have been through this professionally and I have to 100% agree with Elon here. Simply because I have seen too often what 'having a safety team' means. These get established because safety did not work. Instead of changing the culture - so safety is default thinking - you try to establish a department. Which subsequently is hated by everyone because they infringe on product timelines and do not eat their own dogfood. So their safety is usually percentage statistical Excel table magic. Not real safety. I could talk about several instances of this, but cannot due to NDA. But believe me: If someone sells you their safety ,because they have an amazing 'safety team, costing billions in CapEx and OpEx: Walk away. Safety is not their culture, it is a spreadsheet item.</description>
