      <description>CASE UPDATE: MINNESOTA FRAUD SCHEME The FBI is aware of recent social media reports in Minnesota. However, even before the public conversation escalated online, the FBI had surged personnel and investigative resources to Minnesota to dismantle large-scale fraud schemes exploiting federal programs. Fraud that steals from taxpayers and robs vulnerable children will remain a top FBI priority in Minnesota and nationwide. To date, the FBI dismantled a $250 million fraud scheme that stole federal food aid meant for vulnerable children during COVID. The investigation exposed sham vendors, shell companies, and large-scale money laundering tied to the Feeding Our Future network. The case led to 78 indictments and 57 convictions. Defendants included Abdiwahab Ahmed Mohamud, Ahmed Ali, Hussein Farah, Abdullahe Nur Jesow, Asha Farhan Hassan, Ousman Camara, and Abdirashid Bixi Dool, each charged for roles ranging from wire fraud to money laundering and conspiracy. These criminals didn’t just engaged in historic fraud, but tried to subvert justice as well. Abdimajid Mohamed Nur and others were charged for attempting to bribe a juror with $120,000 in cash. Those responsible pleaded guilty and were sentenced, including a 10-year prison term and nearly $48 million in restitution in related cases. The FBI believes this is just the tip of a very large iceberg. We will continue to follow the money and protect children, and this investigation very much remains ongoing. Furthermore, many are also being referred to immigrations officials for possible further denaturalization and deportation proceedings where eligible.</description>

      <description>🇨🇳 CHINA'S MAGLEV HITS 700 KM/H IN 2 SECONDS - PLANNING 1,000 KM/H - WHILE AMERICA ARGUES ABOUT FIXING POTHOLES China just tested a maglev platform that accelerates to 700 km/h (435 mph) in 2 seconds. Target speed: 1,000 km/h (621 mph). That's faster than commercial aircraft. On the ground. The acceleration alone is borderline violent - 0 to 435 mph in two seconds is 9.8g. Fighter jet territory. Passengers would need specialized seating just to survive the launch. But let's address reality: This is a test platform. Prototype speeds don't mean operational trains. China announces ambitious projects constantly. Some materialize (their existing 430 km/h maglev in Shanghai works). Others disappear quietly. The pattern though? They're attempting scale nobody else is. High-speed rail connecting every major city. Maglev research pushed to extremes. Infrastructure spending that makes Western investment look microscopic. Meanwhile in America: Amtrak averages 105 km/h between cities. California's high-speed rail project started in 2008, burned $10+ billion, and hasn't moved a passenger. The fastest train in the U.S. hits 240 km/h for exactly one 54-mile stretch. China's going for 1,000 km/h. Even if they only achieve 800 km/h operationally, that's still triple America's maximum. Here's why this matters beyond trains: Infrastructure capacity signals industrial capability. If China can build and operate 1,000 km/h trains, they can manufacture the precision components, power systems, and control mechanisms that transfer to aerospace, military, and manufacturing. The U.S. won the 20th century partly because it built the Interstate Highway System when others couldn't. China's betting the 21st century winner will be whoever builds impossible infrastructure first. They might fail. Engineering challenges at 1,000 km/h are extreme - air resistance, track precision, emergency braking, passenger safety. But they're trying while America argues whether to fix the L train in New York. Even Chinese failure puts them ahead. You learn more from attempting the impossible than from successfully maintaining mediocrity. Source: Xinhua, CGTN</description>

      <description>This is crazy. In 2022 a disabled Somali whistleblower came forward to expose some of the fraud happening in Minnesota. Afterwards he feared retribution from the Somali community so he fled to Africa but when he arrived there they beat him for talking. 🤣</description>

      <description>Starting in 1973, my mom ran an at home day care. Six kids, zero to 5 yrs old, 8 to 10 hrs a day, mostly by herself, for decades. Her kids still visit her. She never got a million dollar gov't grant for it. States that fund fraud in the name of compassion will get fraud alone.</description>
