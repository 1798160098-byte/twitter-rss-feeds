      <description>The voters should contact their US Senators to urge them to vote on SAVE Act. They can't just be silent on this critical bill that passed by the House many months ago. Time for action!</description>

      <description>🚨 HOLY SMOKES. SCOTUS Justice Sam Alito asks ACLU lawyer "what is a man and a woman?" and they DON'T HAVE A DEFINITION. Alito's response is perfect. ALITO: What does it mean to be a man or woman? ACLU: We do not have a definition for the Court. ALITO: How can a court determine whether there's discrimination on the basis of s*x, without KNOWING what s*x means?! Omg, you can't make this crap up. Seriously.</description>

      <description>The world lost a great man today. I remember seeing Dilbert comic strips as a kid growing up in Saudi Arabia. Little did I know that decades later, I'd get the chance to hang out with its creator and interview him several times. Scott was always gracious and kind to me. Even approaching death, he remained a fighter and tried to be useful until the end. He didn't give up. Millions of people around the world have been positively impacted by his work and I'm grateful to be one of them. What a brilliant mind. Thank you@ScottAdamsSays! May you rest in perfect peace. 🙏🏾</description>

      <description>This is a simple matter of incentives. Illegals, both illegally and eventually legally, vote for the party that supports illegals, which is the Democratic Party. Democrat activists will therefore fight like hell to keep them in the country, as it is their path to power.</description>

      <description>It's funny that anyone believes a one-time, 5% wealth tax for billionaires will stay one-time, or 5%, or for billionaires. The first income tax was 3%, applied to the top 3% of the population. Government always promises to stick in just the tip, and the girls believe it, because they secretly want the whole shaft.</description>
