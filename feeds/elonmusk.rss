      <description>Tesla Cybertruck is one of the best pickup trucks you can buy right now Cybertruck earned a Top Safety Pick+ with a perfect "Good" rating in all major crash tests, making it the only pickup truck to achieve the highest IIHS safety tier in 2025 It also holds a five-star overall rating from NHTSA That’s top-level safety But it does much more: •⁠ ⁠123 kWh battery - equal to about 9 Tesla Powerwalls •⁠ ⁠Can power your house for 3–4 days during a blackout •⁠ ⁠Heavy waterproof and built for extreme conditions •⁠ ⁠Can carry heavy loads and still go faster than most pickup trucks •⁠ ⁠Ultra-Hard 30X Cold-Rolled stainless steel exoskeleton - 7x stronger than typical exterior steel • Cyberbeast: 0-60 mph in 2.6 seconds - faster than most sports cars Cyber truck is a safety + powerhouse on wheels….</description>

      <description>This is what happens when Elon runs your company. xAI which is only 2.5 yrs old and has a team size that is 1/10th of many competitors, its #1 in voice, image generation, image edits, forecasting, and many intelligence leaderboards, all while having the most powerful training center in the world.</description>

      <description>Elon Musk predicts that AI will bypass coding entirely by the end of 2026 - just creates the binary directly AI can create a much more efficient binary than can be done by any compiler So just say, "Create optimized binary for this particular outcome," and you actually bypass even traditional coding Current: Code → Compiler → Binary → Execute Future: Prompt → AI-generated Binary → Execute Grok Code is going to be state-of-the-art in 2–3 months Software development is about to fundamentally change</description>

      <description>Bro… Elon just laid out the blueprint on how xAI and SpaceX are getting to 1,000+ gigawatts per year and beyond, in his closing statement at the xAI all-hands! IMO, this is why there will be no competition in space. 1/ Earth Supercomputers (Now) Build Memphis cluster to get us to &gt;1 GW of power. “We’re only right now using roughly one percent of the potential energy of Earth.” Plan: • 330,000+ Grace Blackwell GPUs • ~1M H100-equivalent compute • 1 gigawatt draw at full scale • Built in &lt;1 year • Tesla Megapacks stabilizing energy FYI, most AI companies are operating in hundreds of megawatts, yet xAI is already at a utility-scale gigawatt compute. 2/ Orbital Datacenters (Soon) Get to 100-200 GW per year launched into orbit with a path to ~1 terawatt (1,000 GW) total from Earth launches. “The next step beyond Earth data centers is our Earth orbital datacenters… launching at the 100-200 gigawatt per year level. Not cumulative, I mean per year.” Benefits: • Continuous solar exposure • No land constraints • No terrestrial grid bottlenecks • Virtually unlimited horizontal expansion FYI, 100–200 GW per year is equivalent to adding multiple large nation-scale grids annually. 3/ Moon Factories + Mass Driver (Mid Future) Get to 1,000+ GW per year, several orders of magnitude beyond Earth. “In order to do that you have to go to the Moon… We are actually going to have a mass driver on the Moon.” Plan: • Lunar factories build AI satellites • Electromagnetic mass driver launches them without fuel • Low lunar gravity reduces launch energy requirements • Scales far beyond Earth’s physical constraints FYI, this is when industrialized compute begins manufacturing off Earth. 4/ Solar System &amp; Beyond (Long Term Future) Today the sun outputs ~3.8 × 10²⁶ watts “If we wanted to use even a millionth of the Sun’s energy, that would be roughly a million times more energy than civilization currently uses.” This means • 0.000001 of the Sun’s output = ~1,000,000 × today’s global Earth energy usage. 🤯 “Earth is really a tiny, tiny dust mote in a vast darkness… The Sun is 99.8% of all mass in the solar system.” To access that scale: • Moon manufacturing • Mars expansion • Solar-orbit compute clusters • Eventually tapping meaningful fractions of stellar output So… the blueprint to get here is 1/ Start at 1 GW. 2/ Scale to 1 TW. 3/ Scale to 1,000+ GW per year. 4/ Then expand toward fractions of the Sun itself. It’s clear that xAI + SpaceX is building the AI infrastructure and pathway to a stellar-scale energy civilization. I really hope I’m still alive to witness all this.</description>

      <description>NEWS: Southwest Airlines has just announced that it will install@Starlinkacross its entire fleet. The first Starlink-equipped aircraft will enter service this summer, and it will be available on more than 300 aircraft by the end of 2026. Starlink Wi-Fi will be free for all passengers. “Starlink delivers that at-home experience in the air, giving Customers the ability to stream their favorite shows from any platform, watch live sports, download music, play games, work, and connect with loved ones from takeoff to landing,” said Tony Roach, Executive Vice President, Chief Customer &amp; Brand Officer at Southwest Airlines.</description>

      <link>https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/42de1156</link>
      <description>ELON MUSK: Over 1 billion people use 𝕏. "The reason we say 1 billion users is actually over a billion users is that while our monthly users are, on average, around 600 million, the number of people who have the X app installed is well over a billion, it's just that most people only occasionally come to the X app when there's some major world event. But as we give people more reasons to use the X app, whether it's for communications, for Grok or for X money, whatever the case may be, we want it to be such that, if you wanted to, you could live your life on the X app, and as we make it more and more useful, we'll obviously give people compelling reasons to use the app every day, and have my expectation is well over a billion daily active users."</description>

      <description>For all the fools that said 𝕏 would be dead by now.… here are the facts the team just shared at the xAI all hands. • New users spend +43% more time in-app (all-time high) • Existing users spend +20% more time (all-time high) • Downloads are up +60% (all-time high) • Subscriptions crossed $1 billion (all-time high) • 120 million downloads per month (achieved 3 consecutive record months) • Highest all-time engagement in January, on track to beat it in February RIP to all the doubters.</description>

      <description>Elon Musk in new presentation: "I really want to see a mass driver on the Moon that is shooting AI satellites into deep space. I can't image anything more epic than a mass driver on the Moon, a self-sustaining city on the Moon, and then going to Mars, throughout our solar system, and ultimately being out there amongst the stars and visiting all these star systems. Maybe we'll meet aliens."</description>

      <description>xAI was reorganized a few days ago to improve speed of execution. As a company grows, especially as quickly as xAI, the structure must evolve just like any living organism. This unfortunately required parting ways with some people. We wish them well in future endeavors. We are hiring aggressively. Join xAI if the idea of mass drivers on the Moon appeals to you.</description>
