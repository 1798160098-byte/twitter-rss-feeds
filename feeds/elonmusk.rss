      <description>“Some people out there may be somewhat skeptical. They may think, well, there isn't some Democrat plan to subvert democracy and achieve a permanent one-party, deep blue socialist state. I assure you, the more you research it, the more you will see it is true.” Elon Musk</description>

      <description>ELON: CIVILIZATIONS FREEZE WHEN RULES NEVER GET DELETED Legislative gridlock paralyze innovation. Using an analogy from Gulliver’s Travels, Elon argued that the U.S. has become a giant pinned to the ground and not by one massive chain, but by "a million little strings" of regulations that make even the simplest progress illegal. Thankfully for the U.S., DOGE isn't just an advisory body; it’s the "garbage collection" function required to prevent the "hardening of the arteries" of America “There’s a thing that happens over time with any civilization. Laws and regulations just accumulate. If there isn’t some forcing function to clean them up, eventually everything becomes illegal. It’s like hardening of the arteries, or being tied down by a million little strings. No single string is the problem. It’s all of them together. There has to be a kind of garbage collection for laws and regulations. Otherwise you just keep adding rules until nothing can move. That’s why big projects stop happening. It’s not that people forgot how to build. It’s that it becomes illegal six ways from Sunday to do anything.” Source:@teslaownersSV</description>

      <description>Straight to the Point: Independent Journalism Will Dominate 2026 How CBS Executives Blocked The Hunter Biden Story "When we did the story, we did it after the (2022) midterms. I argued against that because it was ready before the midterms and my training is that you should always do the story when it's ready to go. You should not be dictated by the political cycle." At that time, CBS News was under different management, and did not respond to our questions seeking comment.@thelatmg@latimes</description>

      <description>All these major media outlets falsely claimed Elon Musk’s enthusiastic wave was a Nazi salute: • The New York Times • BBC • NPR • CNN • Axios • The Washington Post • Reuters • MSNBC • Al Jazeera • USA Today • The Guardian • The Independent They knew it wasn’t true. Yet none of them will dare make the same accusation against Mamdani. This is why the propaganda media is the enemy of the people.</description>

      <description>Elon Musk: To really be intelligent, AI has to make predictions that are in line with reality. “It's incredibly important for an AI model to be grounded in reality. I have a saying, which is physics is the law and everything else is a recommendation. I'm not suggesting people break the laws made by humans, we should generally obey the laws of humans. But I've seen many people break human made laws, but I have not seen anyone break the laws of physics. So, for any given AI, grounding it against reality and reality, for example, as you mentioned with the car, it needs to drive safely and correctly. The humanoid robot Optimus needs to perform the task that it's being asked to perform. These are things that are very helpful for ensuring that the model is truthful and accurate because it has to adhere to the laws of physics. So I think that's actually maybe somewhat overlooked or at least not talked about enough is that to really be intelligent it's got to make predictions that are in line with reality. In other words, physics.” Conversation with Satya Nadella, May 19, 2025</description>

      <link>https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/4cda9be5</link>
      <description>Tesla FSD is life’s time and money glitch. When you’re the driver of a Tesla, you sit down, relax, and let the car handle 100% of the work. It takes you where you need to go while you get your time back with no stress, when normally, the car would be doing nothing and a human would be doing 100% of the work. Then, while you’re at home with your family, sleeping, working, or just living life being present… that same Tesla will be able to go out on its own, pick people up, drop them off, and earn $ for you. This is what makes this technology feel like a glitch that gives you your time back and makes $ for you, all enabled by this technology that lives in every Tesla. For all of history, making income meant trading hours of your hard effort for $, where you gotta show up or you don’t get paid. FSD flips that on its head. Now the car will work for you, whether you’re in it or not and time stops being the limit. Time is the one thing you NEVER get back. And FSD is about making the most of your limited time and keeping you safe, while it works for you in the background whenever you want. I get it now.</description>
