      <description>Friendly reminder that every other developed nation in the world requires voter ID. It’s the most basic, ground-level form of election security. After 4 years of historic illegal immigration, it’s more crucial than ever.</description>

      <description>(February 3, 2026 | 12:15 p.m. CT): In response to Winter Storm Fern, state and local partners worked together to help communities most impacted by prolonged power outages. Through a generous donation from Elon Musk and xAI, the state received and completely distributed 500 generators to the most impacted communities in Tennessee to support residents with urgent needs. Distribution is being coordinated locally.</description>

      <description>- the silent ('zombie') filibuster isn't in the Constitution, it's legit just made up - used to require *actual effort* (talking) - it's blocking one of the most important bills of all time - republicans in the senate could easily end it, unless they continue to apply loser logic Mike is being 100% sensible here. The rest are assuming that it's acceptable to have their legislative agenda (and the will of the voters) blocked until they presumably lose the majority for being so ineffective -- but, as a consolation prize, they'll be able to partially block bills</description>

      <description>This is obvious, really: 1. only citiziens of the country should be allowed to vote in its elections 2. you should have to prove that you are a citizen The vast, vast majority of citizens agree with these statements. The SAVE act is one of the most popular bills in history, yet it is still stuck in the senate! No other developed democracy has the level of potential for fraud and cheating that ours does This should be the number 1 priority of congress! It will not be passed if republicans lose the midterms, no matter how popular it is</description>

      <description>I grew up during Jim Crow. It’s amazing that since the 1960s, the Democratic Party still refuses to accept a simple fact about Black Americans: that, like every other race in this country, we are smart enough to register to vote. There is nothing more demeaning than this racist view of my race. THIS is why I left the Democratic Party 40 years ago and will never, ever go back. Pass the SAVE Act.</description>
