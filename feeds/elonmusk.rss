      <description>“We should be concerned about anything that undermines the 1st Amendment. There is a reason for the 1st Amendment. People came from countries where they could not speak freely - where saying certain things would get you thrown in prison.” — Elon Musk</description>

      <description>Medi Hasan talking about prosecuting Elon Musk isn't actually because Elon is breaking any laws. It's because Elon is very powerful and effective. Think about this.. He owns the most free speech platform on the internet. He himself has over 230 million followers. He is on his way to being worth 1 trillion dollars. He owns the likely fastest advancing AI in the world. He is essentially 100% on the side of the republicans And he is only in his mid 50's meaning he has at least a 20 year runway. That is why democrats would want to prosecute him. He is too big of a threat to their political power.</description>

      <description>Minnesota healthcare companies caught having websites with stock ‘gibberish’ text - They just downloaded a website template - Left the stock text that doesn’t make any sense - Didn’t bother to write any of their own information - Collect millions of US taxpayer dollars Savanah Hernandez “This is how little these people care”</description>

      <description>Rogue Obama judges are going to break judicial review. At which point the question is how many divisions does a district judge -- or the Supreme Court -- have. It would be grand if we weren't here. But the left engineered a judicial coup.</description>

      <description>No ID, automatic voter registration by states and mail in ballots enable massive fraud. Those factors also make it impossible to prove fraud, since there is no ID and no one actually showed up! You can’t conduct exit polls accurately or even count how many people went in to vote.</description>
