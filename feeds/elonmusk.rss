      <description>I was listening to this Nick Shirley interview about Somalians being imported by the Lutheran Church, so I started researching 🚨 It was Barack Obama who paid the Lutheran church NGO and additional NGOs over $100 million to bring in the Somalians and dump them in Minnesota Obama funded it, here’s a list of all the NGOs Barack Obama paid to bring Somalians into America - Lutheran Immigration and Refugee Service - Church World Service - Episcopal Migration Ministries - Ethiopian Community Development Council - HIAS (formerly Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society) - International Rescue Committee - U.S. Committee for Refugees and Immigrants - United States Conference of Catholic Bishops/Migration and Refugee Services - World Relief Corporation Roughly $108 million total funding specifically tied to Somali arrivals</description>

      <description>Nick Shirley: Massive welfare fraud is being committed — and I didn’t come to Minnesota to accuse anyone without proof. I came for evidence. What I found shocked me: daycare centers receiving millions in tax-exempt CCAP funding, yet neighbors say they’ve never seen a single child inside. Locked doors. Blacked-out windows. No access. No transparency. This isn’t a rumor — it’s a pattern. I’ve been investigating this since last June. What started as a demographic story turned into something far bigger. People on the ground kept telling me the same thing: fraud was happening in plain sight. Churches turning into mosques. New “daycares” popping up everywhere. And behind it all — millions of dollars flowing with zero oversight. When I arrived in Minnesota, the first daycare told the whole story. Windows completely blacked out. Doors locked. No way to enter. These places literally had signs that said learing instead learning. Ask yourself — what legitimate business operates like that while collecting millions in welfare funds?</description>

      <description>Male sex offenders going to the women's jail is absolutely the most insane thing going on in society today. The sentencing judge, usually a woman, has to call the rapist "she" and say "her penis." A ruling class designed by Monty Python.</description>

      <link>https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/0051164f</link>
      <description>Sentiments of Venezuelans I’m going to say this once, and I don’t care if it makes people uncomfortable. If you have never lived in Venezuela If you did not grow up there If you did not watch your country collapse in real time If you did not stand in food lines If you did not watch your parents lose everything they built If you did not have to leave your home with nothing Then shut the fuck up. You do not have an opinion. Your opinion does not matter. And you don’t get to lecture anyone about what’s happening there. I’m Venezuelan. I lived there most of my life until my early twenties. I watched my country go from a functioning democracy to full blown socialism right in front of my eyes. This is not politics to me. This is trauma. Before socialism, Venezuela was not perfect, but it worked. There was trade. There was money coming in. There was investment from the US. There were jobs. There was food. There was medicine. My family had five businesses. We had our home We had investments. We had a future. Then the government started nationalizing everything. Private companies were taken. Foreign investors were pushed out. Imports were blocked. Price controls destroyed production. Corruption exploded. And everything died. Not slowly. Violently. People didn’t suddenly become poor because of “capitalism” or “the US” or whatever bullshit slogan people like to repeat online. They became poor because socialism destroyed incentives, destroyed production, destroyed trust, and destroyed hope. People today in Venezuela are not debating ideology. They are trying to survive. They are trying to find food. Trying to find medication. Trying to keep their families alive. So when I see people in the West posting from comfortable homes, full fridges, stable currencies, and safe streets talking about “imperialism” or “US bad” or “Trump this or that” No. It’s not complicated. You’re just ignorant. China is not rebuilding Venezuela. Russia is not rebuilding Venezuela. Cartels are not rebuilding Venezuela. They are stealing. They are extracting. They are draining what’s left. If the US comes in and reinvests If refineries get rebuilt If infrastructure gets restored If imports open back up If food, water, and medicine become accessible again If people can work and earn with dignity Then yes. Let them take all the oil they want. Because at least something gets built instead of destroyed. This is something to celebrate. Not because it’s perfect. But because for the first time in a long time, there is hope. Hope that families can eat. Hope that people don’t have to flee their country. Hope that Venezuela can function again. If you’ve never lived through a country collapsing If you’ve never watched socialism destroy everything around you If you’ve never had to leave your home because staying meant starvation Then again Shut the fuck up. This isn’t theory. This isn’t politics. This is lived experience. By Stephen Subero</description>

      <link>https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/6cf29ff2</link>
      <description>My Venezuela experience as head of trading in the region for Cargill. Cargill was/is the leading producer of critical staple ingredients such as flour, pasta, vegetable oil, and rice in VZ. I am not saying I agree with grabbing the dictator, but I did have a front row seat to the damage a kleptocracy did to innocent people. 1. The government took over our "minute rice" facility at gunpoint because we were "gouging" the nation's poor. The government was never able to run the plant. It never ran again. It was returned years later with no equipment inside 2. There are 1000's of generals in the army. They are each given a slice of the economy to loot. The large number of generals made it difficult to organize a coup against the regime. 3. The government opened grocery stores and sold staples below the cost we sold them to the government. In theory they used petro oil money to lower grocery prices. Our regular grocery outlets were forced out of business. When the government demanded we sell them products below cost we simply had to shut down. The populous became ever more dependent on the government handouts. (PS this is the mayor of New York City's proposal. 4. Dollars- We needed dollars to go buy raw materials like wheat from places like the US and Canada. The government would periodically allocate us some dollars that could only be spent for raw materials and freight. Eventually only the local companies that can and would pay bribes got dollar allocations. We had several facilities closed for lack of raw material 5. My employees liked working for Cargill. The office was an armed compound with access to a gym, high speed internet, global communications, and a weekly box of basic staples. Cargill provided a safe and secure environment if only for the working hours. 6. Employees became very close to others inside the apartment building. Going out on the street with a desperate population was not advisable. 7. I needed wood pallets for feed. We tried to export wood pallets to swap for grain. We refused to pay the bribes it would take to export the pallets 8. I once tried to set up a closed loop wheat planting to flour mill supply chain. A. They came and stole all the seed wheat for food. When we tried to ship in seed wheat in containers via US donors there was no way to get it out of the port without it being stolen 9. Livestock- Our feed business completely collapsed. Even if you could raise a pig, you couldn't defend it from being stolen. People with guns were hungry. 10. Employees- In the end my highly skilled team alone with other highly educated people chose to leave. Cargill often found jobs for them in other Latin countries. The regime was more than happy to see the well-educated leave the country. Setting these employees up with high quality stable jobs after fleeing remains one of the best things I ever did in my career. No one remembers millions in trading earnings. This is a short list. In my opinion the first money spent needs to happen now and it needs to be food. The US is already on the clock. The current regime does not care if it starves the population. The orgy of theft will actually accelerate if they believe their days are numbered. VZ should be an outstanding customer of US grown ag products. Rice, bread wheat, veg oil ect. Feed the people first. Jeff Kazin Former head trading Cargill</description>
