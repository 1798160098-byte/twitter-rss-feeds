      <description>The reason that all liberal insults fail to land is because everybody can see clearly that they won’t follow those insults to their logical conclusion. So, for example, a liberal will call somebody who very clearly has, like, an 85th percentile IQ a complete fucking moron, but they would never say that about dumb kids in failing schools, who they imagine to be just a few more dollars away from careers as astronauts The liberal will call some morally average working guy a “bad person” but on the other hand the violent degenerate on his 50th arrest just needs our help. In this you can see that it is for them merely a status game and they’re only concerned about status with respect to people who they see as status rivals.</description>

      <description>“Liberals say blaming immigrants for the rising crime rates is racist. Yeah but is it true? Of course it is. It’s not a coincidence the quality of life went down after the Somali gangs started a drug turf war using hand grenades. Calling it racist doesn’t solve the problem.”</description>

      <description>This is what the night sky on Mars looks like When night falls on Mars, the sky turns dark and remarkably clear. With its extremely thin atmosphere, Mars offers a sharper view of the cosmos, revealing more stars than we typically see from Earth Mars is accompanied by two small moons, Phobos and Deimos. Phobos streaks across the sky in just a few hours, while Deimos moves slowly, resembling a faint drifting star The Martian sky isn’t pure black. Dust in the atmosphere often gives it a subtle brownish hue, and near sunset, a soft blue glow can appear along the horizon. On especially clear nights, the Milky Way shines brightly, stretching across the sky in stunning detail</description>
