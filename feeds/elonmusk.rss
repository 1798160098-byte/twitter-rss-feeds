      <description>🇳🇱 A Dutch court has sentenced a migrant named Arnold Oforiwaa to 5 years in prison for stabbing his girlfriend 258 times. The prosecutor only asked for 10 years in prison but the judge halved it to 5 years because Arnold was documented “to have very low IQ.” He murdered his ‘girlfriend’ — a young mother — because she focused too much on caring for her newborn and too little on him. He stabbed her 258 (!) times and filmed the mother as she lay bleeding to death. Afterwards he took selfies with the newborn in its mothers blood.</description>

      <description>@DataRepublicanis one of the bravest people I know. She was doxxed, has received death threats, and has faced bomb scares. Yet she pressed forward, documenting exactly how deep the abyss goes. Read this book to see what we saw inside the federal government—and to find the way to fix it.

      <link>https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/d5de8efb</link>
      <description>More and more young white men are looking at Britain, how the ENTIRE country operates, and thinking - why does EVERYBODY ELSE seem to get a helping hand? What have we done wrong? The answer lads, is absolutely nothing. How many young white men have lost out on decent jobs exactly because they are male, and exactly because they are white? Tens and tens of thousands. Likely more. It is institutional and systemic bias against white British men. Anti-white racism is thriving in Britain. Poisonous DEI infects our institutions and corporations. Quotas steal professional opportunities away from bright young men who deserve it. The education system, stacked against you - the forgotten working class white lads who nobody even thinks about, nobody even talks about. Blocked from universities, taught to be ashamed of who you are. The rot MUST end. In the justice system? Who gets the raw end of the deal? Young white men. They tried to implement sentencing guidelines that directly target you, and put you in prison over somebody else for the exact same crime. It is ENDLESS. It seems everyone has a ‘protected characteristic’ apart from you. Under a Restore Britain Government, it will all end. The woke bullshit will end, I promise you that. You now have a political party that will fight for you. We would tear away all of the vile legislation that has made Britain such a hostile and unwelcoming place to its own young men. Our message is clear. There is NOTHING wrong with being white, and there is NOTHING wrong with being male. You’re told that you’re racist for loving your country, chauvinistic for enjoying a few beers at the football, bigoted for having a joke with your mates. It must all end. We must restore confidence to an entire generation of young white men who have been entirely forgotten and let down by the rotten political establishment. My advice is this. Keep working hard, learn a skill, be respectful, have fun, and despite everything - enjoy yourselves. Keep going. It will get better. You now have a political party that properly represents you. Restore Britain.</description>

      <description>Flashback to July 2022: Elon Musk showing Everyday Astronaut the massive leap from messy Raptor 1 (‘Christmas tree’ vibes 😂) to clean Raptor 2 – 230 tons thrust at 300 bar, tons of parts deleted! Fast-forward to 2026: We’re already on Raptor 3 – 280+ tons thrust, even simpler design, no external pipes, in production (100+ built!), testing like crazy, set for Starship V3 flights soon. Insane progress in ~3.5 years!</description>
