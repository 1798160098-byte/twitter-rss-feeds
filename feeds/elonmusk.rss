      <description>This despicably misleading headline is exactly why the American people have completely lost faith in the mainstream media. This journalist knows the facts, was given the truth, and adamantly refuses to report it. Here are the facts: At 6:50 PM CT, federal law enforcement officers were conducting a targeted traffic stop in Minneapolis of an illegal alien from Venezuela who was released into the country by Joe Biden in 2022. In an attempt to evade arrest, the subject fled the scene in his vehicle and crashed into a parked car. The subject then fled on foot. The law enforcement officer caught up to the subject on foot and attempted to apprehend him when the subject began to resist and violently assault the officer. While the subject and law enforcement were in a struggle on the ground, two subjects came out of a nearby apartment and also attacked the law enforcement officer with a snow shovel and broom handle. As the officer was being ambushed and attacked by the two individuals, the original subject got loose and began striking the officer with a shovel or broom stick. Fearing for his life and safety as he was being ambushed by three individuals, the officer fired a defensive shot to defend his life. The initial subject was hit in the leg. All three subjects ran back into the apartment and barricaded themselves inside. The attacked officer and subject are both in the hospital. Both attackers are in custody.</description>

      <description>The xAI offices remind me of the Silicon Valley of 15yrs ago. We can’t hire fast enough. We don’t even have enough desks for everyone until the new building opens. Makeshift desks everywhere. No one cares. Everyone is locked in. Definitive optimism. It’s fucking awesome.</description>

      <description>🚨 After my last video exposing over $110 Million in fraud Tim Walz dropped his run for reelection and multiple federal investigations were launched to stop fraud across the country. In this 51 minute video David and I expose another $16 Million in fraud as Minnesota welfare programs continue to operate fraudulently and steal from law-abiding taxpayers, Like it and share it around everywhere! Accountability and the law must come for the fraudsters and corrupt politicians who have let this happen. The fraud must end.</description>

      <description>The guy is Alaa Abd El-Fattah, he posted on social media that he hates white people, he wants to murder police and native British. The woman on the right is Eva Vlaardingerbroek. She posted some mild criticism of British PM Keir Starmer. Guess which one is banned from Britain?</description>

      <description>It always amazes me that humanity has come this far since the Wright Brothers achieved flight 122 years ago in 1903. We have so much farther to go. The next half of this decade will be wild. Humanity may even set foot on Mars.</description>

      <description>Ilhan Omar wants ICE out of Minneapolis because ICE is arresting her co-conspirators in the multi-billion dollar fraud scheme. 80% of the fraud charges have come from District MN-5. Ilhan Omar’s district. It’s that simple.</description>

      <description>NEW: TSA whistleblower tells Nick Shirley he witnessed Somali people flying millions of dollars in cash in suitcases out of the country every week. "The smallest amount in a suitcase that I heard was like $750,000." "We would rack our heads all the time, like, 'Where are they getting this?' Where in the world are they getting this money?" Absolutely insane. Video:@nickshirleyy</description>

      <description>America is 4% of world population, but illegals can scam money from the government that is higher than 95% of Earth and more than most Americans make! America would be swamped, go bankrupt and then cease to exist at all if illegal immigration enforcement were to be defunded.</description>
