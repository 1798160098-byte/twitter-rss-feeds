      <description>Starlink Wi-Fi review on United Airlines: "If I weren't buckled into a seat, I might not have noticed that I was using in-flight Wi-Fi. When it came to working on my laptop and streaming movies on my phone and tablet, I could have been on my broadband at home. The hardware that makes this happen is a pair of low-profile 500Mbps antennas mounted on the top of the fuselage (pic below). This experience was a demonstration flight on United's first mainline Boeing 737-800 aircraft to be outfitted with the new satellite hardware. Two experiences stood out when I was on the Starlink-equipped plane. First, it operates gate-to-gate, so you can connect on your phone or tablet (laptops still need to be put away during takeoff) as soon as you get settled in your seat. After we'd landed and were taxiing back to the gate, I forgot that I was still connected through Starlink. For almost as long as I've owned a cellphone, wheels-down meant it's time to switch off Airplane mode and embrace the familiar connection of local cellular. Second, the few sign-on steps I had to go through weren't any more onerous than getting on a public cafe or hotel Wi-Fi network. After connecting to the United Wi-FI network, a portal window opened with a trio of screens explaining how great the new service is (you can skip them) and a field to enter my United MileagePlus account and password."</description>

      <description>It turns out interfering with elections is standard fare for the European Commission. Ahead of at least EIGHT elections across six European countries since 2023, the Commission met with platforms to pressure them to censor political speech in the days before the vote.</description>
