      <description>In 1707, two thousand sailors DROWNED. Not because of a storm. Because nobody could tell where they were at sea 🇬🇧 This was the longitude problem. The deadliest puzzle in science. Parliament offered £20,000 to anyone who could solve it. Nearly four million today. Every great scientist in Europe tried. Newton. Halley. The finest minds alive. All of them failed. The man who solved it was a carpenter from Yorkshire. His name was John Harrison. No formal education. No university. No wealthy patron. He taught himself clockmaking. Built timepieces out of wood. His idea was “simple”. If you know the exact time at home and the exact time at sea, you can calculate exactly where you are. The problem? No clock could keep accurate time on a moving ship. Heat warps metal. Cold contracts it. The ocean never stops moving. Harrison spent DECADES on it. H1. Twenty years of work. Not good enough. H2. Better. Still not enough. H3. Seventeen years. Over 700 parts. Still not enough. Then he did something nobody expected. He stopped building clocks. He built a watch. H4. Thirteen centimetres across. The most important watch ever made. They sent it across the Atlantic. Eighty-one days at sea. When they arrived, it had lost five seconds. Five seconds. In eighty-one days. The problem was solved. But here's the uncomfortable part. They didn't give him the prize. The Board of Longitude was run by astronomers. The very men who'd been trying to solve it their own way. The Astronomer Royal was both judge and competitor. They changed the rules. Demanded his designs. Refused to pay. A working-class carpenter had beaten every astronomer in Europe. And the establishment couldn't accept it. Harrison was nearly EIGHTY before he got justice. He went directly to King George III. The king tested the watch himself and told Harrison to petition Parliament with the king's full backing. Parliament paid. Harrison died three years later. After his death, every ship on earth carried a chronometer based on his design. Every GPS satellite. Every ship's navigation. Every flight path. All of it traces back to a carpenter from Yorkshire who taught himself to build a watch. His watches are still at the Royal Observatory in Greenwich. Still ticking. Still perfect. The establishment tried to bury him once. We're not letting it happen again 👇proudofus.co.uk/supportBe part of us. Be proud of us. 🇬🇧</description>

      <description>🚨🇺🇸 REID HOFFMAN CLAIMS "THE FBI CLEARED ME" ON EPSTEIN... THE FILES SAY OTHERWISE Reid Hoffman is now claiming the FBI cleared him of any wrongdoing related to Epstein. Let's review what the files actually show: He visited Epstein's island in November 2014. Stayed at his Manhattan townhouse. Went to his New Mexico ranch. Weeks after Virginia Giuffre's sex trafficking allegations went public in December 2014, Hoffman sent Epstein Christmas gifts: ice cream for him or "for the girls" and "something that may strike your funny bone for the island." He sent Epstein a metal sculpture saying it would "have an appropriate nature to the island." Then he offered to help manage the scandal: "Been giving a bit of thought to how I can help with the recent press fu." He left his passport at Epstein's place in 2016. Continued meeting with him through 2018, despite previously claiming contact ended in 2015. There's a photo of him sitting at a table with Epstein. "Cleared" is doing a lot of heavy lifting here. The files show a man who knew about the allegations, kept visiting, sent gifts "for the girls," and offered PR help. I think the word he was looking for was ‘documented,’ not ‘cleared.’</description>

      <description>xAI was reorganized a few days ago to improve speed of execution. As a company grows, especially as quickly as xAI, the structure must evolve just like any living organism. This unfortunately required parting ways with some people. We wish them well in future endeavors. We are hiring aggressively. Join xAI if the idea of mass drivers on the Moon appeals to you.</description>
