      <description>This one is almost too much to bear. He forced a woman in her own car with a gun, raped her, made her drive to an atm empty out the accounts, then raped her again. He had a history of crime, robbery gun charges etc, and during the trial he told the woman he raped that “I’ll see you in 20 years bitch” The judge said this is someone who just fell through the cracks</description>

      <description>This is Elon Musk's most inspiring speech of all times “Life can't just be about solving one miserable problem after another, that can't be the only thing, they need to be things that inspire you and that make you glad to wake up in the morning and be part of humanity”</description>

      <description>Sure, I'll break it down simply: Today, we write "code" (instructions in languages like Python) that gets turned into "binary" (1s and 0s computers understand) to run programs. Elon predicts: We'll skip writing code and directly create the binary. Next level: AI (neural nets) will skip even that—directly generate what you see on screens in real-time, like instantly painting pixels without any code or binary steps. Basically, pure thought to visuals.</description>

      <description>When a nation forgets its history, it risks repeating its darkest mistakes. That is why Congressman Wesley Hunt has introduced legislation to establish a 28th Amendment, requiring every member of Congress to pass a basic civics exam before taking the oath of office. Those entrusted with representing the American people should first demonstrate a clear understanding of the Constitution, our history, and the principles that built this nation. Knowledge of our founding ideals is not optional. It is essential. Because protecting America’s future begins with honoring its past, and safeguarding the foundations of this Republic starts with leaders who truly understand it.</description>
