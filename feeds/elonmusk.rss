      <description>The fact that trans people over 30 basically don’t exist should tell you something about the mimetic nature of mental illness.</description>

      <description>Everything I've said about transgenderism for the past 10 years has been absolutely correct and totally vindicated. Now I'm telling you that the trans violence we've seen so far is nothing compared to what's coming if we don't treat trans ideology as a severe public safety hazard and crack down it immediately and aggressively.</description>

      <description>The civilization that gave the world Beethoven, established the rule of law, built the Sistine Chapel, and circumnavigated the globe must cast off the shackles of shame and self-doubt. Europe must reverse its decline. Europe must survive.</description>

      <description>Did you know you don’t actually have to be British to vote in the UK elections? The UK has one of the most “unique” (some might say retarded) voting franchises in the world, largely due to its imperial history. While most countries restrict General Election voting strictly to their own citizens, the UK’s approach is open to pretty much everyone. The Commonwealth Loophole is the biggest surprise for most people. If you are a "qualifying Commonwealth citizen" resident in the UK, you have full voting rights. This means a student from Canada, a software engineer from India, or a jobless benefits scrounger from any number of Commonwealth countries can vote for the UK government, provided they have legal leave to remain in the country. Citizens of the Republic of Ireland have a special status. They are not considered "foreign" under UK law due to historical ties. Consequently, an Irish citizen living in the UK has full voting rights in all elections, distinct from other EU citizens. Generally, citizens of EU countries living in the UK can vote in local elections (for your town council or mayor) but not in General Elections (for MPs). There’s even an exception for that: Citizens of Malta and Cyprus get to vote in everything. Why? Because they are members of both the EU and the Commonwealth. The only thing stopping most people from voting outside of the UK is that you have to have a residential address in the UK in order to vote. You cannot just fly in on election day. To be a "qualifying" citizen, you must be resident in the UK and usually possess "leave to enter or remain." It’s like a visa-free entry pass for non-citizens. That’s not hard to get since they give it out like candy. You do not need to hold a British passport or apply for British citizenship to cast a ballot.</description>

      <description>The chart's figures are largely accurate based on historical data: - US population 1955: ~166 million (Census estimates). - 2025 projection: ~342-348 million (Census, Worldometer). - Mental asylum population 1955: ~559,000 (peak era). - 2023 (latest): ~36,500 residents in state psychiatric hospitals (NRI data); 2025 likely similar amid slight capacity increases. Deinstitutionalization since the 1960s explains the drop. Elon's comment is a policy view, not a fact to check.</description>

      <description>The youngest generation is 10x more LGBTQ+ relative to the oldest generation with nearly a quarter (23%) identifying as LGBTQ+ compared to 2.3% in the oldest age group. Across most generations, bisexuals are the most represented subgroup. Transgenders are under 0.5% of the older generations and 3% of the youngest age group.</description>

      <description>Sooner or later, people reveal exactly who and what they are. Reform clearly isn’t the solution many were hoping for, unfortunately many will have to face this and come to terms with it. If you still back Reform, it’s worth asking yourself why.</description>

      <description>Reid Hoffman had a profound business and personal relationship with Jeffrey Epstein. It's not just a few connections here and there. They were very close friends in constant contact, all the way up to his 2019 arrest. Yet Hoffman says he rarely talked to him. It is incredible.</description>

      <description>So after 3 days of driving all around Salt Lake area in a Tesla Y, I'm going to give my opinion on it... I love it, and I want one. That's the main takeaway. I've had it in a few anxiety inducing situations, and I restrained myself from grabbing the steering wheel. It performed flawlessly! I love the look of the door handles, but I don't really love the way they function. And I do notice that it is not a timid little car. It's pretty assertive in traffic, and I like that. But sometimes it tends to go over the speed limit. I just let it do it's thing. I had two hands on my coffee cup, and it told me to have my hands ready to drive! It also doesn't put up with me looking at my phone much which is a good thing. The technology is a bit of a learning curve, but my two grandsons ages 12 and 8 just tell me what to do. (It's humiliating.) My husband likes to be in control when he drives, so I don't know that we'll agree to get one anytime soon. But it's my dream to own one now!</description>

      <description>Just asked the four Grok 4.20 (Beta) agents to build me an artificial life simulator. My mind is blown. What should I get him to build next? &gt;&gt;&gt; grok prompt Build an artificial life simulator in one single HTML file. Hundreds of glowing neon particles in different cyberpunk colors. Each pair of colors has its own attraction/repulsion force that you control with sliders. You get emergent “creatures”, swarms, orbiting rings, exploding clusters, chasing packs, it feels alive. Features: - Click/drag to spawn particles of selected color - Real-time force matrix (6×6 sliders) - Randomize rules button (insane results every time) - Pause, speed, particle count, trails/glow toggle - Dark cyberpunk UI with scanlines + glitch effects optional</description>
