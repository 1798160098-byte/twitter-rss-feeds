      <description>GROK 4.20 JUST SMOKED GPT‑5, CLAUDE, AND GEMINI It beat GPT-5, Gemini 3, and Claude in forecasting real-world events. Only actual humans who do this for a living are ahead of it. And Elon says the best parts of Grok 4.20 aren’t even online yet. This version isn’t even finished training. Just imagine what Grok 5 will be able to do!</description>

      <description>When USADF blocked DOGE from accessing their building last year, Democrats applauded. Now we know it is because USADF was hiding bribes, kickbacks, and fraud. I have filed the Terminate Unaccountable Spending, Abuse, Deception, and Fraud (USADF) Act to defund these crooks.</description>

      <description>Q4 Shareholder Update →ir.tesla.com— Highlights 2025 marked a critical year for Tesla as we further expanded our mission &amp; continued our transition from a hardware-centric business to a physical AI company. We also laid the foundation for the future of Tesla by further advancing FSD Supervised, launching our Robotaxi service, beginning to install production lines for Cybercab &amp; fine-tuned our production-primed Optimus design while expanding our AI training infrastructure. In 2026, we will further invest in the infrastructure needed to support clean energy + transport as well as autonomous robots. This includes the ramp of 6 new production lines across vehicle, robots, energy storage &amp; battery manufacturing. We're building a world of amazing abundance. LFG! Automotive – APAC region continues to show strength across multiple markets &amp; set a record for deliveries this quarter – Preparations in North America continue for the production ramps of Tesla Semi &amp; Cybercab, both commencing in the first half of 2026 &amp; production of the next gen Roadster Energy generation + storage – Highest quarterly energy storage deployments, driven by record Megapack deployments – Total gross profit = $1.1 billion, marking our 5th consecutive record quarter! – Megapack 3 &amp; Megablock production starting at Megafactory Houston this year – In 2025, Powerwall network supported more than 89k Virtual Power Plant events across &gt;1 million installed units, saving homeowners &gt;$1 billion in electricity bills Robotics – Planning to unveil Optimus Gen 3 in Q1 this year, our first design meant for mass production – Start of production planned by end of 2026, with eventual planned capacity of 1 million robots/year AI Training Compute – Currently building Cortex 2 at Giga Texas to further increase our AI training compute capacity – In the first half of 2026, we're planning to more than double the size of onsite compute in Texas (in terms of H100 equivalents) Battery – Our lithium refinery started pilot production. It is the first spodumene to lithium hydroxide refinery in North America, with a simpler, cheaper &amp; more environmentally friendly process – Started producing battery packs for certain Model Ys with our 4680 cells, unlocking an additional vector of supply – We now produce dry electrode for 4680 cells with both anode + cathode made in Austin – We expect both domestic cathode material in Austin &amp; LFP lines in Nevada to begin production this year AI Software – Shipped latest version of FSD Supervised (V14), which will drive you to your destination, find a free spot &amp; park AI Inference Compute – Development of our in-house, custom designed AI5 &amp; AI6 inference chips for autonomy progressed during Q4, with production planned for 2027 &amp; 2028 respectively – Targeting a 50x improvement for AI5 compared to AI4, thanks to 10x raw compute, 9x memory capacity &amp; 5x hardened block quantization &amp; softmax function (= enabling efficient low precision computing without sacrificing model accuracy) Automotive + Other Software – Robotaxi app no longer has a waitlist in the areas we serve – Our vehicles keep getting better with over-the-air software updates: Grok w/ navigation commands, Photobooth, Supercharger Site Maps, Automatic HOV Routing, &amp; more Robotaxi – Began testing driverless Robotaxis in Austin in December &amp; began removing safety monitor from customer rides in January – Our Bay Area ridehailing service now serves SJC, with plans to expand to other Bay Area airports upon receiving required permitting – Cumulative paid Robotaxi miles have now exceeded 600k FSD Supervised – Launched in Korea, where customers drove &gt;1 million kilometers in just one month – We continue to pursue regulatory approval in China &amp; Europe – FSD Supervised subscriptions more than doubled in 2025</description>
