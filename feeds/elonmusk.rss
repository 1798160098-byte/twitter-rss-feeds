      <description>Our officer was ambushed and beaten with snow shovels and broom handles. This was an attempted murder of federal law enforcement. The details that@CNNis too afraid to address here is: all three of the illegal aliens involved in last night’s violent attack on law enforcement were let into our country by the Biden administration.</description>

      <link>https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/54e40890</link>
      <description>WEAPONIZATION: RINOs in Congress overruled the president to fund the anti-America, anti-Free Speech NGO called the National Endowment for Democracy (NED). Its CEO, Damon Wilson, makes more than the president and his husband runs a government-funded hair salon in Washington DC. Why do taxpayers need to support every grifting Democrat and their pet NGOs?</description>

      <description>If you are the founder of a highly valued illiquid startup, set some time aside and read this entire article. The act is designed to bankrupt you and to personally punish any appraiser or accountant who disagrees.</description>
