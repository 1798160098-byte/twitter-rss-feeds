      <description>i've been testing grok 4.20, and it's surprised me i asked it to scaffold a small local dev app for an SQL-backed search tool, and it gave me clean setup steps plus ready-to-run python and html templates ran it once and it worked immediately. for a quick prompt-to-working-code loop, that's impressive</description>

      <description>Our of all the Epstein docs, the only two people who did something about it were Trump and Elon. - Trump reported him to police. - Elon ghosted him and cut him off. Even took a hit for it at Tesla's expense. Nobody else in the elite did jack. That tells you a lot.</description>

      <description>Artificial intelligence products will reflect the biases of the humans who create them. If anything, the flaws in human nature will be exacerbated by AI.</description>

      <description>The more I use xAI's new Grok 4.20 and its completely visible council deliberation process during response generation, the clearer it becomes that transparency—from an epistemic standpoint—needs to become the gold standard for all AI models. Anything less than that moving forward is a detriment to both users and AI alignment as a whole.</description>

      <description>Do you really think grok 4.20 is good? I've been testing it , Visual ability is flawed. I was looking at logic tests, and I'm not able to create difficult enough. However, proving theorems—with theorem provers—is quite difficult with it; there soo many syntax errors.</description>
