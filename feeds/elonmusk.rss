      <description>This is literally true. Editing Wikipedia was a major for-credit assignment in a Berkeley "Studies" course. As a Wokist might say: "Don't automatically assume you're just imagining things."</description>

      <description>Wilberforce, and people like him, ended the global slave trade that had existed for several thousand years. They didn’t invent it, but they did stop it. I should say almost entirely. There are still remnants of it in some parts of the world.</description>

      <description>I remember when@JohnCleesewas a devout Liberal Democrat. He declined a peerage, which was a pity because he'd have been a formidable presence in the House of Lords. His political journey is fascinating. Indeed, it merits a doctoral thesis (which I'd be happy to supervise).</description>

      <description>If black and brown people can be proud of their races, why not whites? If black and brown people can be indigenous and native, why not whites? It’s this lack of symmetry and equality that’s driving current resentments on all sides.</description>

      <description>2-year-old Jeremy Poou-Caceres was shot and killed while walking with his mother. Authorities say an illegal immigrant from El Salvador — who already had a deportation order — was responsible for the shooting. His face hasn’t been everywhere. There were no marches, no nonstop headlines, no nationwide outrage for this little boy. His life mattered, even if the outrage never came.</description>

      <description>In Florida, home of the Space Coast, we understand nothing launches without verification. Before liftoff: ✔️ Fuel check ✔️ Systems check ✔️ Safety check Before voting: 🗳️ Citizenship check It just makes sense. Let’s pass the SAVE America Act.</description>

      <description>Britain took on fifty nations. African kings. Arab sultans. Bombarded ports. Deposed rulers who refused. Lost 1,600 men. Spent 40% of the entire Treasury. A debt so big it wasn't paid off until 2015. You or your parents were still paying for it. Not for land. Not for gold. To end the slave trade. They captured 1,600 ships. Freed 150,000 people. Patrolled 3,000 miles of coastline for sixty years. And none of it was the government's idea. It was 400,000 ordinary people who signed petitions and 300,000 families who refused to buy sugar. They forced Parliament's hand. Your ancestors changed the world and nobody told you. If you think this should be taught in schools, help us reach more people:proudofus.co.uk/supportBe part of us Be Proud Of Us 🇬🇧</description>
