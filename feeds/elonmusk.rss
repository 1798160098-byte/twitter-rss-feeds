      <description>🚨 HOLY CRAP! A Minnesota man who’s been living next to a Somali “daycare center” for eight years says he’s never seen a SINGLE CHILD there “None! Not at all… and I’ve been here since 2017!” “They’re stealing the money!” He even called on Tim Walz to be JAILED over this. I agree! 🎥@nickshirleyy</description>

      <description>🇨🇳 TESLA MODEL Y FALLS OFF 800-METER CLIFF IN CHINA... DRIVER WALKS AWAY This is absolutely insane. A Tesla Model Y plunged off an approximately 800-meter cliff in China, tumbling down a mountainside. The vehicle was completely destroyed, windows shattered, body mangled beyond recognition. But the A- and B-pillars held. The passenger cabin didn't collapse. The battery didn't ignite. The driver suffered only minor injuries. Rescue crews had to dismantle the wreckage to recover the vehicle. Local reports are calling it a "miracle of survival." This is what happens when a car is engineered with safety as a priority, not an afterthought. Tesla's rigid structural design and low center of gravity from the battery placement aren't just marketing points. They're the reason this driver is alive. 800 meters is over 2,600 feet. That's not a fender bender. That's falling off a mountain. Most vehicles would have become a coffin. The Model Y became a survival pod. Source:@elonmusk/@ray4tesla</description>

      <description>OPINION: ANTI-WHITE HATE CRIMES ARE RISING, AND THE MEDIA DOESN’T WANT YOU TO NOTICE In Hawaii, 2 guys beat a white man with a shovel for moving into their village. Told him, “No white man is ever going to live here.” Hate crime, right? Took a federal case just to admit it. In 2024, most racial hate crime victims in Massachusetts were white. Some will downplay it, but that’s state data. Don't expect to hear it on cable news, though. During 2020 and 2021, anti-white hate crimes hit their highest numbers in years, right when media was busy blaming whiteness for everything wrong in America. Coincidence? Sure, and I’ve got a bridge to sell you. The media cherry-picks outrage. If the victim’s white and the motive is racial, the story disappears. Hate is hate... unless it messes with the narrative, of course. Source: propublica, bjs, bostonherald,</description>

      <description>SpaceX’s new Raptor 3 is the most advanced rocket engine ever built Key upgrades over earlier Raptors: • Nearly double the thrust compared to Raptor 1 • About 4× cheaper to manufacture, dramatically lowering launch costs • A simplified design that saves over 40 metric tons of mass per Starship launch • Durable enough to eliminate the need for an external heat shield, reducing complexity and maintenance Raptor 3 is designed to fly on Starship Version 3, with first flight targeted for early 2026</description>

      <description>🚨🇩🇪 AFD SURGES TO 26% IN GERMAN POLLS AS MIGRANT RAPE STATS SPARK OUTRAGE Germany's AfD party just rocketed to 26% in the latest polls, making it the country's top political force for the first time ever. Experts point to the ruling coalition's endless squabbles under Chancellor Merz as a big driver, plus AfD ramping up its bold talk and internal shakeups. At the same time, fresh BKA crime data is blowing up: Islamic migrants from Afghanistan and Africa are linked to gang rape suspects at rates way higher than locals, Afghans at 41 per million residents, Africans at 23, other foreigners at 3, versus just 0.6 for Germans. That's up to 70x the rate, and folks are asking why Germany keeps rolling out the welcome mat despite the risks. The migrant crisis, loaded with crime concerns like these gang rape disparities, is straight-up mobilizing voters toward AfD. Frustrated Germans see the government fumbling immigration, and AfD's tough stance on borders and security is pulling in support from all sides, turning public anger into poll gains.
