      <description>My friend’s cousin recently went out in Milan and ended up at an afterparty. What began as a normal night quickly turned into a nightmare. A group of Somalis held him against his will, took all of his belongings, and threatened him. They forced him to log into his accounts and transfer all of his money and cryptocurrency. He was threatened with knives and guns and genuinely believed he was going to die. In the end, he fought back and managed to escape, knowing they might kill him, but feeling it was his only chance. I have never heard of something remotely like this happening to someone in my social sphere before third-world mass immigration to Europe.</description>

      <description>🇨🇳 TESLA MODEL Y FALLS OFF 800-METER CLIFF IN CHINA... DRIVER WALKS AWAY This is absolutely insane. A Tesla Model Y plunged off an approximately 800-meter cliff in China, tumbling down a mountainside. The vehicle was completely destroyed, windows shattered, body mangled beyond recognition. But the A- and B-pillars held. The passenger cabin didn't collapse. The battery didn't ignite. The driver suffered only minor injuries. Rescue crews had to dismantle the wreckage to recover the vehicle. Local reports are calling it a "miracle of survival." This is what happens when a car is engineered with safety as a priority, not an afterthought. Tesla's rigid structural design and low center of gravity from the battery placement aren't just marketing points. They're the reason this driver is alive. 800 meters is over 2,600 feet. That's not a fender bender. That's falling off a mountain. Most vehicles would have become a coffin. The Model Y became a survival pod. Source:@elonmusk/@ray4tesla</description>
