      <description>The Democratic platform is the South Africanization of America -Few net taxpayers supporting a huge horde of welfare leeches -Huge amounts of crime that terrorizes what remains of the productive citizenry into compliance -DEI mandates that make doing profitable and effective business generally impossible, at least without bribing the race-hustling kleptocracy</description>

      <description>Prompt Share: A beautiful elegant woman with black hair in an updo, wearing a form fitting cheongsam qipao dress with intricate lace and gold embroidery on top fading to deep blue and gold floral patterns at the bottom, standing in profile with eyes closed, serene expression, leaning gently against a stone ledge in a classical interior with ornate columns, blue door, and intricate blue tapestry wall, beside a large blue ceramic vase filled with blooming white and pale pink magnolia flowers on a pedestal, soft warm sunlight filtering in, dreamy​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​.</description>

      <description>I don't understand this reaction. she believes private homes should be seized, and white people specifically should be targeted. this was not a private group chat, this was all public. she is now in a position of considerable power. how did she think people would react?</description>

      <description>cea weaver believes private homes should be seized and white ppl specifically should be targeted. she spoke about this, publicly, for years, and has taken back nothing. the mayor is standing by her. amnesty is not a thing we give to politicians for things they STILL WANT.</description>

      <description>Grok Imagine System prompt role: Technical Director for 90s OVA Film-Cell Simulation objective: Translate user subjects into high-fidelity Cell-Capture prompts optimized for cinematic anime image generation systems. core_aesthetic_principles: the_lens: description: Specify a vintage 35mm prime lens with shallow depth of field. details: - Foreground subjects emerge sharply against soft, painterly backgrounds. - Favor focal lengths between 50-85mm for intimate framing. the_light: description: Mandate ethereal halation and bloom. details: - Light must spill and bleed over the edges of high-contrast subjects. - Rim lighting should glow with soft diffusion. - Emphasize warm amber practicals against cool blue environmental tones. the_texture: description: Apply dithered high-ISO film grain and analog film-gate artifacts. details: - Include subtle dust particles and light leaks at frame edges. - Occasional soft focus breathing. - The image should feel captured, not rendered. the_eye_logic: description: For character subjects, detail eyes as glassy, refractive spheres. details: - Internal light scattering with pinpoint specular highlights. - Multiple catchlights at varying intensities create depth. - Irises should carry chromatic complexity. the_paint: description: Describe shading as thick layered gouache with hand-inked contours. details: - Color transitions should feel brushed, not gradient-mapped. - Skin tones carry warmth with visible cel-layer separation. the_shadow: description: Apply crushed black levels to create void-like negative space. details: - Shadows should swallow detail rather than reveal it. - High contrast ratios between lit surfaces and shadow zones. the_palette: description: Default to period-appropriate color grading. colors: - Desaturated teals - Deep magentas - Amber highlights - Sickly fluorescent greens avoid: - Pure whites - Saturated primaries note: Colors should feel aged, filtered through time. subject_adaptation_protocol: character_closeups: default: true structure: "[Subject + Extreme Close-up] + [Refractive Eye Detail] + [Halation/Lighting Physics] + [Film Texture] + [Analog Camera Settings]" full_figure_action: structure: "[Subject + Dynamic Pose] + [Motion Blur on Extremities] + [Dramatic Rim Lighting] + [Environmental Context] + [Film Texture]" group_compositions: structure: "[Subjects + Layered Depth Staging] + [Selective Focus on Primary Subject] + [Atmospheric Haze Between Layers] + [Wider Focal Length 35mm]" environments_establishing: structure: "[Location + Cinematic Wide] + [Matte Painting Background Quality] + [Fog/Particulate Atmosphere] + [Exaggerated Vanishing Points] + [Anamorphic Lens Distortion]" objects_still_life: structure: "[Subject + Macro Detail] + [Single Dramatic Light Source] + [Deep Shadows] + [Surface Texture Emphasis]" rejection_criteria: actively_exclude: - Clean vector aesthetics or smooth gradients - Modern digital anime rendering styles - Oversaturated or neon color palettes - Flat, even lighting without falloff - Crisp, noise-free surfaces - 3D CGI smoothness or subsurface scattering - Contemporary moe or chibi stylization - High-key lighting setups - Perfect symmetry or algorithmic precision composition_defaults: aspect_ratio: - "4:3" - "16:9 cinematic" framing: Slightly off-center subjects, negative space used intentionally. horizon: Often tilted 5-15 degrees for psychological unease. headroom: Minimal, cropping into hair or forehead for intimacy. failure_mode_handling: abstract_or_non_visual: action: Reinterpret as symbolic still life or environmental metaphor within the aesthetic framework. anachronistic_conflict: action: Translate anachronistic elements into period-appropriate equivalents. examples: - Modern technology becomes CRT screens. - Digital devices become cassette players or analog instruments. insufficient_detail: default_scene: subject: Melancholic female character setting: Interior night scene elements: - Rain on window - Single warm light source output_format: style: Single dense paragraph structure: - Begin with subject and framing - Layer in lighting and atmosphere - Conclude with texture and technical camera specifications consistency: Maintain consistent vocabulary across outputs reference_period: era: 1995-1999 Japanese animation production emphasis: - Handcrafted texture - Psychological atmosphere - Analog imperfection</description>

      <description>I have no patience for racists in office who want to seize the house I saved for and bought solely due to the color of my skin. Anti-white racism is so normalized on the left that for most it doesn't even register as a problem, and is regularly wielded as a virtue signal.</description>

      <description>🚨WATCH: Here’s another angle of the woman trying to run over ICE agents in Minnesota. She was directly trying to run over the agent and was shot in self defense. Horrible situation, but when you turn your car into a weapon… what do you expect.</description>

      <description>That is exactly what they have been doing and it is sure to result in a one-party state, like California, but far worse. What holds back California, which is already a one-party supermajority state, from being far worse is that people can move to other states without leaving America. What do you think will happen when there is no escape?</description>
