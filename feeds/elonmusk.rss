      <description>I was listening to this Nick Shirley interview about Somalians being imported by the Lutheran Church, so I started researching 🚨 It was Barack Obama who paid the Lutheran church NGO and additional NGOs over $100 million to bring in the Somalians and dump them in Minnesota Obama funded it, here’s a list of all the NGOs Barack Obama paid to bring Somalians into America - Lutheran Immigration and Refugee Service - Church World Service - Episcopal Migration Ministries - Ethiopian Community Development Council - HIAS (formerly Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society) - International Rescue Committee - U.S. Committee for Refugees and Immigrants - United States Conference of Catholic Bishops/Migration and Refugee Services - World Relief Corporation Roughly $108 million total funding specifically tied to Somali arrivals</description>

      <description>Nick Shirley: Massive welfare fraud is being committed — and I didn’t come to Minnesota to accuse anyone without proof. I came for evidence. What I found shocked me: daycare centers receiving millions in tax-exempt CCAP funding, yet neighbors say they’ve never seen a single child inside. Locked doors. Blacked-out windows. No access. No transparency. This isn’t a rumor — it’s a pattern. I’ve been investigating this since last June. What started as a demographic story turned into something far bigger. People on the ground kept telling me the same thing: fraud was happening in plain sight. Churches turning into mosques. New “daycares” popping up everywhere. And behind it all — millions of dollars flowing with zero oversight. When I arrived in Minnesota, the first daycare told the whole story. Windows completely blacked out. Doors locked. No way to enter. These places literally had signs that said learing instead learning. Ask yourself — what legitimate business operates like that while collecting millions in welfare funds?</description>

      <description>Male sex offenders going to the women's jail is absolutely the most insane thing going on in society today. The sentencing judge, usually a woman, has to call the rapist "she" and say "her penis." A ruling class designed by Monty Python.</description>

      <link>https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/ef976747</link>
      <description>Sentiments of Venezuelans I’m going to say this once, and I don’t care if it makes people uncomfortable. If you have never lived in Venezuela If you did not grow up there If you did not watch your country collapse in real time If you did not stand in food lines If you did not watch your parents lose everything they built If you did not have to leave your home with nothing Then shut the fuck up. You do not have an opinion. Your opinion does not matter. And you don’t get to lecture anyone about what’s happening there. I’m Venezuelan. I lived there most of my life until my early twenties. I watched my country go from a functioning democracy to full blown socialism right in front of my eyes. This is not politics to me. This is trauma. Before socialism, Venezuela was not perfect, but it worked. There was trade. There was money coming in. There was investment from the US. There were jobs. There was food. There was medicine. My family had five businesses. We had our home We had investments. We had a future. Then the government started nationalizing everything. Private companies were taken. Foreign investors were pushed out. Imports were blocked. Price controls destroyed production. Corruption exploded. And everything died. Not slowly. Violently. People didn’t suddenly become poor because of “capitalism” or “the US” or whatever bullshit slogan people like to repeat online. They became poor because socialism destroyed incentives, destroyed production, destroyed trust, and destroyed hope. People today in Venezuela are not debating ideology. They are trying to survive. They are trying to find food. Trying to find medication. Trying to keep their families alive. So when I see people in the West posting from comfortable homes, full fridges, stable currencies, and safe streets talking about “imperialism” or “US bad” or “Trump this or that” No. It’s not complicated. You’re just ignorant. China is not rebuilding Venezuela. Russia is not rebuilding Venezuela. Cartels are not rebuilding Venezuela. They are stealing. They are extracting. They are draining what’s left. If the US comes in and reinvests If refineries get rebuilt If infrastructure gets restored If imports open back up If food, water, and medicine become accessible again If people can work and earn with dignity Then yes. Let them take all the oil they want. Because at least something gets built instead of destroyed. This is something to celebrate. Not because it’s perfect. But because for the first time in a long time, there is hope. Hope that families can eat. Hope that people don’t have to flee their country. Hope that Venezuela can function again. If you’ve never lived through a country collapsing If you’ve never watched socialism destroy everything around you If you’ve never had to leave your home because staying meant starvation Then again Shut the fuck up. This isn’t theory. This isn’t politics. This is lived experience. By Stephen Subero</description>
