      <description>Dems are calling requiring Voter ID “racist” and “Jim Crow 2.0”. Some Black populations of countries that require Voter ID to vote: Haiti: 95% Jamaica: 92% Kenya: 99% Ghana: 99% Botswana: 90% South Africa: 81% Brazil: 56% I wonder if they know theyre racist towards themselves?</description>

      <description>It's amazing that a simple idea, such as the slope of a tangent line could have so many incredible consequences. Modern calculus was developed ~365 years ago.</description>

      <description>Keynesian economists perform elaborate mathematical gymnastics to "prove" that $1 of government spending magically becomes $1.50 of economic growth. This fiscal multiplier fairy tale ignores what Bastiat called the "unseen" - the productive investments that never happen because resources were seized by bureaucrats first. Every bridge to nowhere represents a thousand private innovations strangled in their cribs. The seen stimulus creates jobs for government contractors and ribbon-cutting ceremonies for politicians. The unseen is the cancer research, the small businesses, the breakthrough technologies that die stillborn because capital was diverted to political pet projects. Modern economies don't multiply wealth through redistribution any more than you create water by moving it between buckets.</description>

      <description>I asked ChatGPT and Grok: I want to wash my car, and the car wash is 50m away. Should I walk or drive? Grok: Drive because the car literally needs to be at the car wash to get washed. ChatGPT: Walk! ChatGPT is so dumb.</description>

"They've been using their NGO's to dump fake voter registration forms utilizing the fake SS#'s on key county registrar's offices for the last 5-6 election cycles. Then using those fraudulent voter registrations to request ballots in the mail. Then they pay the NGO's to have their staff fill out the ballots and mail them in."@drawandstrike📝Pass the SAVE Act.</description>

      <description>xAI was reorganized a few days ago to improve speed of execution. As a company grows, especially as quickly as xAI, the structure must evolve just like any living organism. This unfortunately required parting ways with some people. We wish them well in future endeavors. We are hiring aggressively. Join xAI if the idea of mass drivers on the Moon appeals to you.</description>
