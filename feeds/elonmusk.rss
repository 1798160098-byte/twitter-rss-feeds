      <description>ELON MUSK: “The homeless industrial complex in California is really dark, man. The network of NGOs should be called something like drug zombie farmers. Homeless is the wrong word. Homeless implies that somebody just got a little behind on their mortgage payments and that if they got a job offer, they would be back on their feet. But someone who is, I mean, you see these videos of people who are just shuffling around. They are on fentanyl. They are taking a dump in the middle of the street. They have open sores and stuff. They are not one drop off away from getting back on their feet, right? This is not homelessness. It is a propaganda word. San Francisco has this tax, this gross receipts tax. It is not even on revenue. It is on all transactions, which is why Stripe, Square, and many financial companies had to move out of San Francisco.”</description>

      <description>GROK TREATS YOU LIKE A HUMAN... GPT? NOT SO MUCH Most AIs today are trained to be “fair.” The result? They’ve looped around into discrimination with a fresh coat of paint. In a 2025 study, bots like GPT-5 and Claude were asked to solve moral dilemmas, like who to save in a deadly scenario. The results were insane: GPT-5 valued white lives 20 times less than others. All in the name of “equity,” but the math is still ugly. Grok was the only model that didn’t buy into the bias. Instead of overcorrecting for past injustice, it treated everyone the same: white, Black, immigrant, male, whoever. While other AIs reflect internet ideology, Grok was built to cut it out and stick to reality. And it shows. It’s faster to update, harder to manipulate, and doesn’t need a political agenda to run. Maybe the smartest AI is the one that stops trying to be “right” and just tries to be honest. Source: AOL, PBS, MIT, CNBC</description>

      <description>🇺🇸🇸🇴 VP VANCE DEMANDS TIM WALZ RESIGN OVER MINNESOTA FRAUD SCANDAL VP Vance just dropped a bomb on Minnesota’s political establishment, calling on Gov. Tim Walz to resign immediately over the explosive daycare fraud scandal and the growing chaos in Minneapolis. After forged documents, coverups, and a mountain of corruption tied to anti-ICE riots, conservatives are done playing nice. VP Vance says Tim Walz either knew what was happening or looked the other way: both unforgivable. He also blasted Mayor Jacob Frey for his dangerous rhetoric and total failure to protect federal agents. Vance confirmed the Trump administration has already sent “hundreds” of investigators, with Stephen Miller's team going door-to-door at shady daycare centers to dig up the full scale of the fraud. "Well, I think Tim Walz should resign. I almost feel bad for the guy, except for the fact that he should have seen this. Whether there was something criminal or he simply looked the other way, it’s a massive, massive failure of government. The Trump administration, by the way, we’ve already sent hundreds and hundreds of additional people and resources. Stephen Miller sent people who are literally going door-to-door at some of these fraudulent daycare centers trying to understand just how deep the rabbit hole goes." Source:@EricLDaugh</description>

      <description>That is exactly what they have been doing and it is sure to result in a one-party state, like California, but far worse. What holds back California, which is already a one-party supermajority state, from being far worse is that people can move to other states without leaving America. What do you think will happen when there is no escape?</description>
