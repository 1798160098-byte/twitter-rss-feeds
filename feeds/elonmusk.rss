      <description>Breaking News: The Starlink R500 million plan is still on halt by the South African, even though Elon Musk’s business isn’t willing to benefit a single a cent. They are keeping Starlink on halt, because they fear that it may be a game changer. Elon Musk is willing help over 5 million learners in rural areas with internet connection, which is something they don’t have. But still the government didn’t approve of this deal. The enemy of South Africans is the government we have.</description>

      <description>X Files Appeal Against €120M EU Fine Under Digital Services Act X filed an appeal at the General Court of the European Union challenging the €120 million fine imposed by the European Commission on 5 December 2025, the first non-compliance fine under the Digital Services Act (DSA). This EU Decision resulted from an incomplete and superficial investigation, grave procedural errors, a tortured interpretation of the obligations under the DSA, and systematic breaches of rights of defence and basic due process requirements suggesting prosecutorial bias. This landmark case is the first judicial challenge to a DSA fine and could set important precedents for enforcement, penalty calculations, and fundamental rights protections under the 2022 regulation. X remains committed to user safety and transparency while defending our users' access to the only global town square.</description>

      <description>Nearly one Houstonian EVERY 10 DAYS is murdered by a repeat felon released back onto the streets. That is unacceptable in Texas. We must use and expand every tool available to remove recalcitrant DAs and keep violent criminals off our streets.</description>

      <description>AUSTIN MAN pulled up to a 7-Eleven at 3 a.m., shot a father of five dead in the parking lot, and drove off. Caleb Jenkins now faces murder charges. But prosecutors had chances to stop him. November 2023: Jenkins, a convicted felon, was caught with a firearm. DA José Garza's office declined to prosecute. No charges filed. That same month: arrested for assault causing bodily injury/family violence. He skipped court. Bond was forfeited. Warrant issued. Re-arrested. Bond increased again. That case is still pending, two-plus years later. August 2024: caught with over four ounces of marijuana. DA declined again. No charges filed. October 2025: Quinton Arnold is dead in a 7-Eleven parking lot. Jenkins' record since 2012: • 3 gun charges — 2 days jail total • Felon caught with firearm — DA passed • 2 family violence assaults — dismissed or deferred • Protective order violation — dismissed • Multiple marijuana charges — dismissed or declined • Skipped court repeatedly across multiple cases A felon with a gun. Prosecutors said pass. Now there's a dead body.</description>

      <description>I did a lot of moaning and groaning about my husband getting a cyber truck but the self-driving feature is completely life changing. Call me a convert. I’ve never felt so safe in a car. Putting my kids in any other car feels reckless by comparison</description>

      <description>In 2023, at the Cybertruck Delivery Event, Tesla said that they would launch a RWD Cybertruck with a 250 mile range for $61k Today, they launched an AWD Cybertruck for $60k with 325 miles of range, 4.1s 0-60, outlets and tonneau for even less than they said the RWD would be. Cheaper, more range, AWD, and quicker. Count inflation and the current new AWD price near matches the ones shown in 2019 too.</description>
