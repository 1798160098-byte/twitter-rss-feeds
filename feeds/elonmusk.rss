      <description>36,500 killed in two days? They're massacring their own civilians. Where are the protesters in the west -- the university encampments, the street protests, the UN, Hollywood?</description>

      <description>Question for Americans from a dumb Aussie about the Minnesota thing. Obama used ICE to deport approx 3M illegals, and got the nickname "Deporter in Chief". And he wasn't even voted in on doing that. There were some protests, but nothing even remotely violet or crazy. Why is now everyone so violet and crazy? Is there any other explanation apart from Orange Man Bad?</description>

      <description>Enrique Bautista Vasquez is a 20-year-old illegal accused of sexually assaulting a 14-year-old autistic girl. He allegedly lured her to his Cathedral City apartment on New Year's Eve. Julio Cesar Xocop-Vicente, a criminal illegal alien from Guatemala, killed Amber Paris, a 15-year-old girl and American citizen, after running a stop sign while speeding and striking her with his vehicle. He fled the scene and was arrested the next day, but was released by local authorities, allowing him to walk free on bond before ICE could file an immigration detainer. Worse, local authorities then dismissed his driving-without-a-license charge on December 2, 2025, while Paris was still fighting for her life. This isn't the first time he has been arrested and set free under sanctuary policies. This is who the Democrats are protecting. Who you vote for matters.</description>
