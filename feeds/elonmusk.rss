      <description>Elon was right about everything Bill Gates and Reid Hoffman are the most named in the Epstein files – enough to show they had very deep connections and were Epstein's close associates They were terrified of Trump winning Reid Hoffman personally funded legal cases against Trump to keep him in prison using non-profit organizations It's all out now, and it's real and true just as Elon said it</description>

      <description>The Cybercab has two seats because ~85% of car trips in North America have just one or two people. For the remaining 15% of trips that have more than two people, you'll be able to hail a Model Y robotaxi, or even a couple of them.</description>

      <description>Highly ironic: &gt; in 14 states, you don't have to show **any ID at all** to vote in federal elections &gt; requiring ID to vote is "Jim Crow 2.0" according to Schumer and other politicians &gt; but to shovel snow in NYC you must show 2 forms of ID + social security card This is an IQ test for our civilization It's paramount that we see through manipulative and highly idiotic rhetoric and pass the SAVE America Act. Proving citizenship to vote is one of the most popular policies in history (84% support across both parties).</description>

      <description>Timing is important. But we need to give xAI algo team credit as well. It’s been huge to have niche interest distributed out in front of the right readers without needing to do any sketchy baiting or algo hacking.@VladSaigauand I started purposefully posting deep quantitative analysis into the void back in June 2025. It was a slog. In ~September of last year we saw a noticeable increase in engagement, which then super charged when we started posting our orbital data center analysis into November/December. I truly believe that now is the best time to put in the work and flood X with high quality content. Grok and X get better with a steady diet of high quality analysis.</description>

      <link>https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/d3440908</link>
      <description>There is direct incentive for states with large illegal populations to resist deportations &gt; there's a loophole in the Constitutional definition of a census that counts *all residents* &gt; this includes 30m+ illegal immigrants &gt; therefore states and counties with large populations of illegal immigrants get greater representation in Congress! Regardless of which states or counties this benefits, this is *NOT* an acceptable loophole in the democratic process</description>
