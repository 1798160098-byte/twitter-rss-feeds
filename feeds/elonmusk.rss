      <description>Happy to share that the Government of Gujarat has exchanged a Letter of Intent with@Starlink, a subsidiary of@SpaceX, to strengthen digital connectivity across the state. This LoI will enable high-speed satellite-based internet connectivity in remote, border, tribal and underserved areas with limited telecom infrastructure, accelerating Gujarat’s Digital Connectivity Mission and strategic digital initiatives. Inspired by the visionary leadership of Hon'ble Prime Minister Shri@narendramodiJi and his#DigitalIndiamission, this collaboration will support e-governance and Common Service Centres, schools, primary health centres, tele-medicine services, disaster management systems, ports, wildlife sanctuaries and key government institutions. The initiative will ensure reliable digital service delivery in aspirational and tribal districts, strengthen education and healthcare outreach, enhance disaster preparedness and security systems, and improve access to government services for citizens. In view of the need for seamless and easy connectivity across the state, a Joint Working Group comprising representatives of the Government of Gujarat and Starlink will be constituted to ensure the effective implementation of this LoI - contributing to the vision of#ViksitBharat2047.@elonmusk@LaurenDreyer@prabhakarpj</description>

      <description>Elon Musk has figured out the Soros racket. It doesn’t involve Soros spending his own money. It involves Soros making a seed investment so he can get his hands on your money. He then makes you pay, through the government, to fund your own destruction.</description>

      <description>Elon Musk: The purpose of no voter ID is obviously to conduct fraud in elections “The same people that demanded vaccine IDs, if you want to travel or do anything, are the same ones who say no voter ID is required. Obviously hypocritical. It's so that fraud cannot be proven. So it enables large-scale fraud and no way to prove it, because how would you prove it? It's literally impossible. No ID. You're not even allowed to show your ID. It's insane. The purpose of no voter ID is obviously to conduct fraud in elections. They come up with some nice-sounding thing. Their common rebuttal is like, it's racist to require ID, which is insane. I think it's actually racist and patronizing to say that people can't figure out how to get an ID. You need an ID for everything. Like, the list of the things you need an ID for is basically everything, except voting.”</description>

      <description>Given how close Steve Bannon and Epstein were up to Epstein's arrest, Bannon was likely involved in nearly every illegal activity that Epstein engaged in. At the very least, he had detailed knowledge of numerous crimes and never reported them. It's time to investigate Bannon.</description>

      <description>The fact that Steve Bannon was a Trump-hating degenerate and an ally who was trying to clear the “good name” of Jeffrey Epstein through the production of a documentary is only the tip of filth-encrusted iceberg. He is a fraudster of the highest order, from the start ‘til now, and has been involved in numerous scams with convicted Chinese fraudster Miles Guo who pretended to be a billionaire while simultaneously fleecing his own followers for over a billion dollars through a web of investment scams as he masqueraded as an anti-CCP crusader. It’s all money that went to fund his extravagant lifestyle… and Bannon’s.</description>
