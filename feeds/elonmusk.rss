      <description>California is not OK. There is a vast expansion of nonprofit graft that doesn’t serve the people it claims to help. Simultaneously to that, it’s becoming harder than ever to conduct normal business and create new private sector jobs. Stop the grift!wsj.com/opinion/the-scandal-…</description>

      <description>Welcome to Minneapolis. A town where your likelihood of parking in front of a random daycare is significantly higher than most towns. A town where the restaurants that don’t cook food make more money than those that do. Why deal with customers, complaints, staff etc when you can instead just serve the government with your “protected identity?” A town where 100+ year old local, white businesses get pushed out and turned into Halal restaurants, Islamic centers, and mosques. A place where you feel pressured to not walk alone and with your hair out, because it’s just soooo incredibly inappropriate. I mean just think about all the welfare men who loiter and monitor the streets as a career, surely the temptation of a woman wearing jeans could be too much for them to handle. Also, We the People are told it’s too expensive to have kids while Somalians are religiously and monetarily encouraged to have 9+. What will become of us?</description>

      <description>Grok is beating ChatGPT because a lot of normies are discovering Grok now. On TikTok there are people making Grok edits where they ask a question, ChatGPT says something dumb, Grok is way more human and smart. This one has over 300k likes. There are hundreds of them. And the comments are filled with pro Grok replies.</description>

      <description>Governor Walz has provided oversight over one of the largest and most pervasive frauds in our country’s history. As such, he is not only not electable, he likely needs time to prepare for his defense for the potential criminal charges he may face. This was not a difficult decision for him. It was the only decision he could make in light of his circumstances.</description>

      <description>I can confirm public speculation that Ambassador Abukar Dahir Osman, Permanent Representative of Somalia to the UN and President of the Security Council, is in fact associated with Progressive Health Care Services, a home health agency in Cincinnati. HHS has previously taken action against Progressive in response to a conviction for Medicaid fraud. More to come.@HHSGov</description>
