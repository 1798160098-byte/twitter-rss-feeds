      <description>OPENAI FOUNDERS PLOTTED TO OUST ELON IN 2017 New court docs reveal the plot was never about "safety" it was about getting rich Greg Brockman’s private diary from Sept 2017 exposes the scheme to kick Elon out: "This is the only chance we have to get out from Elon... Financially, what will take me to $1B?"

      <description>BREAKING: Stephen Miller just CALLED OUT what's happening across America between Democrats and DHS and he didn't HOLD BACK! "This is clearly an INSURGENCY against the federal government. They are describing the federal government as an occupying force." "If you were to permit individual cities and states to ratify their own immigration laws for themselves, then you wouldn't have a republic and you wouldn't have a country, and that's the proposition that Fry and Ellison and Walsh are trying to test." "They are asserting that they have the unfettered right to harbor aliens who have no right to be in this country, and to incite a violent insurrection from organized agitators against federal forces to prevent those federal forces from effectuating duly enacted immigration law." It's time to INVOKE THE INSURRECTION ACT NOW!</description>
